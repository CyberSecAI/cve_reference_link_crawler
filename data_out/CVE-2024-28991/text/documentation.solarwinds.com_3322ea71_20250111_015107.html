### CVEs

**Last updated:** Sept 9th, 2024

SolarWinds would like to thank our Security Researchers below for reporting on the issue in a responsible manner and working with our security, product, and engineering teams to fix the vulnerability.

#### SolarWinds CVEs

| CVE-ID | Vulnerability Title | Description | Severity | Credit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2024-28990 | SolarWinds Access Rights Manager (ARM) Hardcoded Credentials Authentication Bypass Vulnerability | SolarWinds Access Rights Manager (ARM) was found to contain a hard-coded credential authentication bypass vulnerability. If exploited, this vulnerability would allow access to the RabbitMQ management console. We thank Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) for its ongoing partnership in coordinating with SolarWinds on responsible disclosure of this and other potential vulnerabilities. . | 6.3 Medium | Piotr Bazydlo (@chudypb) of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| CVE-2024-28991 | SolarWinds Access Rights Manager (ARM) Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution | SolarWinds Access Rights Manager (ARM) was found to be susceptible to a remote code execution vulnerability. If exploited, this vulnerability would allow an authenticated user to abuse the service, resulting in remote code execution. We thank Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) for its ongoing partnership in coordinating with SolarWinds on responsible disclosure of this and other potential vulnerabilities. | 9.0 Critical | Piotr Bazydlo (@chudypb) of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |

## Known issues

Last updated:

### Configwizard error

In some cases where the ARM server fails to restart automatically after the update, an error occurs in the basic config while configuring the Rabbit MQ credentials.

**Resolution or workaround**: Manually restart the ARM service. If the error persists, delete the pnServer.messaging.config.xml file and restart the ARM service

### Exchange scan fails

When you run a scan on Microsoft Exchange, the scan fails and the following message is displayed on your screen:

`Abnormal process termination`

**Resolution or workaround**: SolarWinds recommends repairing the ARM installation, as the account is set for the Exchange scan in ARM. For additional workarounds, contact [SolarWinds Technical Support](https://www.solarwinds.com/company/contact-us).

This issue is still under investigation.

### Collectors do not reconnect to the ARM server after you restart the ARM Service

When you restart the ARM Service on the ARM server, the collectors do not reconnect to the ARM server.

**Resolution or workaround**: Restart the ARM Service on each collector machine. Repeat this process until each collector connects to the ARM Server. See [ARM collectors do not connect after the update to ARM 2024.3](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/ARM-collectors-do-not-connect-after-the-update-to-ARM-2024-3) located on the SolarWinds Support website for instructions.
