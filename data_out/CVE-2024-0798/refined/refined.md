The provided content is a commit diff from a Github repository and a generic footer from huntr.com.  It does not relate to any specific CVE description.

The commit diff shows changes to the file `server/endpoints/system.js`. The changes appear to add role-based access control to some API endpoints, specifically:
- `/system/system-vectors`
- `/system/remove-document`
- `/system/remove-folder`
- `/system/local-files`

The diff adds `flexUserRoleValid([ROLES.admin, ROLES.manager])` middleware to these routes, suggesting that these endpoints previously did not require specific user roles.

However, there is no mention of any vulnerability or any information that can be used to understand the root cause of the vulnerability or attack vector.

Therefore, the response is:

NOINFO
