The provided content relates to CVE-2023-31087.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The JS Job Manager plugin for WordPress, versions <= 2.0.0, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the website without their consent. This could potentially lead to various impacts depending on the actions that can be triggered, including unauthorized modifications, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could craft a malicious webpage or email that tricks a logged-in administrator or editor into performing an action they didn't intend to. This could involve sending a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin on the targeted website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges on the WordPress site to visit a malicious site or open a malicious email. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated but needs to target an authenticated user of the affected website.
