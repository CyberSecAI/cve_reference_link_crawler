{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user input in the `user_id` parameter of the attendance-info.php script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying the database, or even gaining control over the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `attendance-info.php` script, specifically injecting malicious SQL code into the `user_id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, which would likely be accessible on the network, with the ability to modify POST parameters."
