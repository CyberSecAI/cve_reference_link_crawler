The provided content relates to a memory leak fix in the Intel PMC core driver within the Linux kernel. It addresses the scenario where device registration fails during module initialization.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - When the `platform_device_register` function fails during module initialization, the allocated `pmc_core_device` structure is not properly freed. The original code used `kfree(pmc_core_device)`, which doesn't release all associated resources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Memory leak: The allocated memory for the `pmc_core_device` and its associated resources is not released when registration fails.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Repeated failures in device registration would lead to memory exhaustion, potentially degrading system performance or causing instability.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - This is not directly exploitable by an attacker. It's a bug in the driver's error handling logic. The vulnerability is triggered when device registration fails during the initialization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - No specific attacker capabilities or position are needed. The memory leak is triggered by a failure during the normal device registration process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix replaces `kfree(pmc_core_device)` with `platform_device_put(pmc_core_device)`. The latter function is the proper way to deallocate resources allocated for platform devices.
- This commit is backported to stable kernel releases starting with 5.9.
