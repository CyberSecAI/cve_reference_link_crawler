In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: fix memleak on registration failure

In case device registration fails during module initialisation, the
platform device structure needs to be freed using platform_device_put()
to properly free all resources (e.g. the device name).
