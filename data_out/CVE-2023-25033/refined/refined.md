- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Social Share Boost Plugin <= 4.5 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions within the plugin's context. The specific impact would vary based on the actions the plugin allows to be performed through the vulnerable requests.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious link or embed code on a website that, when clicked by an authenticated user, triggers a forged request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website containing malicious code to execute the CSRF attack. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
