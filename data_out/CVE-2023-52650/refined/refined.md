If `of_find_device_by_node()` fails to find a device node, it returns NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when trying to access members of the potentially NULL gangster pointer.",

       "Impact": "A NULL pointer dereference could lead to a system crash or denial-of-service.",
       "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through device tree configuration where the 'nvidia,ganged-mode' property is present but the corresponding device is not found.",
