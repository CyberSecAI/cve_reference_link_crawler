Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-48251:

**CVE-2024-48251:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `get_band_confirmed()` function within the `Activated_gridmap_model.php` file. This function constructs SQL queries using string concatenation, directly embedding user-supplied data (specifically, `$band`, `$sat`, `$propagation`, and `$mode` parameters) into the query without proper escaping or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code through the mentioned parameters, an attacker can manipulate the database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or even complete database compromise.
    *   **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerability is located in code that lacks session authentication, which means any user, even without authentication, can make requests to the vulnerable endpoint, exploiting the SQL injection. This is an unauthenticated SQL injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
    *   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **System Compromise:** Depending on the database server configuration and permissions, an attacker could potentially gain control of the underlying system.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `getGridsjs()` function of the `Activated_gridmap` controller, specifically targeting the vulnerable parameters `band`, `sat`, `propagation`, and `mode`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability because the controller action is not protected by session verification.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content highlights a lack of adequate input validation. While XSS sanitization is present, it is insufficient to prevent SQL injection, as it doesn't sanitize for SQL syntax.
*   The blog post from substack provides exploit details, including the use of the SQLMap tool to demonstrate exploitation with time-based blind SQL injection payloads.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves using prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
