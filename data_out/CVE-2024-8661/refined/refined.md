Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-8661:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient sanitization of the output of the "Next&Previous Nav" block in Concrete CMS. Specifically, the labels (nextLabel, previousLabel, and parentLabel) were not properly sanitized before being displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious code injected into the labels of the "Next&Previous Nav" block is stored in the system and executed when a user views a page containing this block.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject JavaScript code that could perform a wide range of malicious actions within the context of a user's browser.
- **Account Hijacking:** If the malicious code can steal cookies or session tokens, an attacker could potentially hijack user accounts.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal data from users or execute actions on their behalf.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the visual appearance of pages.
- **Redirects:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Concrete CMS administration interface.
- A user with administrative privileges (a "rogue admin") can add or modify a "Next&Previous Nav" block.
- The attacker can inject the malicious payload within the "nextLabel," "previousLabel," or "parentLabel" fields of the block during configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker must have administrative privileges within the Concrete CMS instance.
- **Block Modification Permissions:** The attacker must have the ability to add or modify "Next&Previous Nav" blocks.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable field:** The attacker has to know that the labels in the "Next&Previous Nav" block were vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

- **Versions Affected:** The vulnerability affects Concrete CMS versions 8 and 9.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the output of labels using the `h()` function (likely an HTML escaping function) in the block's controller.
- **CVSS Score:** The Concrete CMS Security Team assigned a CVSS v4 score of 4.6 with the vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.
- **Mitigation:** The fix involves sanitizing the output of the next, previous and parent labels of the block.
- The vulnerability was reported through HackerOne.
- The fix was implemented with commit [12204](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12204) for version 9 and commit [ce5ee2ab83fe8de6fa012dd51c5a1dde05cb0dc4](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/commit/ce5ee2ab83fe8de6fa012dd51c5a1dde05cb0dc4) for version 8.
