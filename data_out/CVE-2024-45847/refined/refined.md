{
  "cveId": "CVE-2024-45847",
  "description": "An arbitrary code execution vulnerability exists inside the *_dispatch_update*function of the *mindsdb/integrations/libs/vectordatabase_handler.py*file. The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authorized on the MindsDB instance and allows them to run arbitrary Python code on the machine the instance is running on. The vulnerability exists because of the use of an unprotected *eval*function, which can be used with multiple integrations.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of the `eval` function on user-controlled input, specifically the 'embeddings' column in an 'UPDATE' statement.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') (CWE-95)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server where MindsDB is running.",
    "attackVectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted 'UPDATE' statement on a table that utilizes any of the affected integrations where the 'embeddings' column is set to malicious Python code.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker must be authenticated to a MindsDB instance that has any of the affected vector database integrations installed (PgVector, Milvus, LanceDB, Xata, Qdrant, Pinecone, ChromaDB, or WeaviateDB)."

  "affectedProducts": [
    {
      "name": "MindsDB",
