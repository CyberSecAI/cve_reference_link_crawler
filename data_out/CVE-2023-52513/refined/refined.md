{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A newly created RDMA endpoint, when failing immediate MPA request processing, unlinks the listening endpoint. The code that handles the later TCP socket close did not correctly account for this case, causing a NULL dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Incorrect handling of connection failures",
      "Missing check for NULL listener"
    ],
    "impact": "A NULL dereference crash in `siw_cm_work_handler()` when dereferencing a NULL listener.",
    "attack_vectors": "By triggering a connection failure during the immediate MPA request processing, an attacker can cause the newly created endpoint to be dropped and subsequently trigger the NULL dereference on socket close.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to initiate RDMA connections that might fail during the immediate MPA request processing. They also need to be able to trigger a TCP socket close after such a failure."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Cancel the useless MPA timeout if immediate MPA request processing fails.",
    "Add check to ensure listener is not NULL before dereferencing in `siw_cm_work_handler()`",
     "Suppress scheduling a useless TCP socket read in `sk_data_ready()` if the socket is not in TCP_ESTABLISHED state."
