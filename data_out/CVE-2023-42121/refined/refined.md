- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication checks before granting access to certain functionalities within the web interface of Control Web Panel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication leading to unauthorized access to functionalities
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a valid Control Web Panel user.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability via the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No prior authentication is required for exploitation, and the attacker needs to be able to interact with the web interface of the affected Control Web Panel instance.
