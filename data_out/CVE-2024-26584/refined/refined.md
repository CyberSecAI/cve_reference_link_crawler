Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the patch:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way the Linux kernel's TLS implementation interacts with the crypto API when using asynchronous offload accelerators. When the `CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG` flag is set on crypto requests, the `crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt}` functions can return `-EBUSY` if the crypto queue is full. In these situations, the crypto API enqueues the request to a backlog and processes it later. The asynchronous callback will then be invoked twice: first with `err == -EINPROGRESS` and then again with `err == 0`. The original code was not designed to handle this behavior correctly which would have resulted in an error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Handling of `-EBUSY`:** The TLS code was not properly handling the `-EBUSY` return code from the crypto API. It was expecting `-EINPROGRESS` when async operations were initiated.
- **Double Callback Issue:** The crypto API's behavior of calling the async callback twice, first with `-EINPROGRESS` and then with `0`, was not handled properly, potentially leading to incorrect state management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The vulnerability does not appear to be directly exploitable for arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation. However, it could lead to:
- **TLS Operation Failures:**  The improper handling of `-EBUSY` could lead to errors in TLS encryption or decryption, causing TLS connections to fail.
- **Performance Issues**: If not handled correctly, the error could lead to excessive retries or other performance degradation in TLS connections.
- **Potential race condition**: Although not explicitly described, mishandling of multiple callbacks can cause potential race conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is not from a remote system. Instead it is an internal issue due to high load.

- **Triggering Crypto Backlog:** An attacker (or a legitimate user under heavy load) could trigger the vulnerability by creating a large number of TLS connections or by sending large volumes of data, leading to a filled crypto queue and triggering the `-EBUSY` return code.
- **Artificially Low `cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen`:** As noted in the patch description, the issue can be easily triggered by artificially lowering the `cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen` value which controls the maximum queue length for crypto requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would not be an external attacker, but a local user.
- The attacker would need the ability to generate TLS traffic or have the ability to set the sysctl `cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen` value.

**Patch Details:**

The patch addresses the vulnerability by:
- **Converting `-EBUSY` to `-EINPROGRESS`:** When the crypto API returns `-EBUSY`, the patch now uses the new `tls_*crypt_async_wait()` helpers to correctly wait for the crypto request to complete and convert `-EBUSY` to `-EINPROGRESS`.
- **Ignoring First Callback:** The patch now correctly ignores the initial async callback with the `-EINPROGRESS` error code, preventing double processing.
- **Using New Helpers:** New helpers, `tls_decrypt_async_wait()` and `tls_encrypt_async_wait()`, are used to handle asynchronous waiting, simplifying the fix and avoiding modifications to existing error handling paths.

In summary, this patch resolves an issue in the Linux kernel's TLS implementation where it was not correctly handling the backlogging of crypto requests when using asynchronous offload. This is not directly exploitable, but could lead to TLS connection errors or performance issues.
