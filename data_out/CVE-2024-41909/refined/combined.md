### **[ecki](/ecki)** commented [Dec 19, 2023](#issue-2048232109)

| Description Hello,  is Mina or any contributor planning to work on adding the new OpenSSH protocol extension "strict-KEX" for mitigating Terrapin attacks?  Also did somebody check for the counter overflow conditions mentioned in the advanced counter manupulation section of the paper?  BTW: when implementing config options, I would do it like jssh which allows to define a "required" mode, so you can set up a listener which rejects any handshakes without this protection. (if you want to make "supported" configurable I dont care, seems to be not a big compat problem if implemented correctly)  In addition to resetting the counters the strict mode probbaly also should reject the "filler" debug and ignore mesages - I hope PMC received detailed guidance from the Terrapin team? Motivation Users want to mitigate the new protocol attac which can only work if client and server are extended. Alternatives considered Turning off the ciphers is an interop problem.

| According to [OpenSSH PROTOCOL](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/PROTOCOL) - section `1.9 transport: strict key exchange extension`  Ater sending or receiving a SSH2\_MSG\_NEWKEYS message, reset the packet sequence number to zero  However, it does not specify **which** sequence number to reset - the incoming our outgoing. Bear in mind that the NEWKEYS message is "symmetrical" - if we sent one, then an incoming one is due any time and vice versa. Since the sequence number is part of the encryption (if this is not the 1st NEWKEYS) then we need to know whether we sent the request or are responding to it. |

| According to [OpenSSH PROTOCOL](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/PROTOCOL) - section `1.9 transport: strict key exchange extension`  Ater sending or receiving a SSH2\_MSG\_NEWKEYS message, reset the packet sequence number to zero  However, it does not specify **which** sequence number to reset - the incoming our outgoing. Bear in mind that the NEWKEYS message is "symmetrical" - if we sent one, then an incoming one is due any time and vice versa. Since the sequence number is part of the encryption (if this is not the 1st NEWKEYS) then we need to know whether we sent the request or are responding to it.  Strict key exchange resets the sequence number of the corresponding direction after it has received a SSH\_MSG\_NEWKEYS message. I. e. when receiving SSH\_MSG\_NEWKEYS from the remote peer reset the incoming sequence number, when sending SSH\_MSG\_NEWKEYS reset the outgoing sequence number. The SSH\_MSG\_NEWKEYS itself is handled under the old sequence numbers (sequence number 0 will be the first message after SSH\_MSG\_NEWKEYS). |

| I pretty much figured this out on my own - the comment was just a reminder for myself to figure the correct implementation. Thanks for your answer - it puts me more at ease to know that others have reached the same conclusion I did. |

| Yeah, I expected that kind of response, given that I replied 6 hours later. If any additional questions pop up during the implementation of "strict kex", just let me know. I'm most likely going to be able to answer them. |

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2023-48795](https://togithub.com/warp-tech/russh/security/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8)

### Summary

Terrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More
precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By
carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an
attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client
or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or
server noticing it.

### Mitigations

To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called
\"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a
Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as
well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.

**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this
countermeasure.**

As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected
algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until
patches are available.

### Details

The SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix
truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension
negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the
first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling
attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting
Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be
practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode.
Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit
previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle
scenario.

The attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of
SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently
removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange
has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the
excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence
numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial
key exchange.

In the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on
every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state
other than the message's sequence number. In the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC
cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using
this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR
and stream ciphers.

For more details see
[https://terrapin-attack.com](https://terrapin-attack.com).

### Impact

This attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH
implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These
algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a
consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH
implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to
downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH
extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable
attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle
(MitM) scenario.

### Man-in-the-middle attacker can compromise integrity of secure
channel in golang.org/x/crypto
[CVE-2023-48795](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48795) /
[GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8)
/ [GO-2023-2402](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2402)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A protocol weakness allows a MITM attacker to compromise the integrity
of the secure channel before it is established, allowing the attacker to
prevent transmission of a number of messages immediately after the
secure channel is established without either side being aware.

The impact of this attack is relatively limited, as it does not
compromise confidentiality of the channel. Notably this attack would
allow an attacker to prevent the transmission of the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO
message, disabling a handful of newer security features.

This protocol weakness was also fixed in OpenSSH 9.6.

#### Severity
Unknown

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2023-48795](https://togithub.com/warp-tech/russh/security/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8)

### Summary

Terrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More
precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By
carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an
attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client
or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or
server noticing it.

### Mitigations

To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called
\"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a
Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as
well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.

**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this
countermeasure.**

As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected
algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until
patches are available.

### Details

The SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix
truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension
negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the
first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling
attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting
Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be
practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode.
Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit
previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle
scenario.

The attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of
SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently
removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange
has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the
excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence
numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial
key exchange.

In the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on
every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state
other than the message's sequence number. In the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC
cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using
this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR
and stream ciphers.

For more details see
[https://terrapin-attack.com](https://terrapin-attack.com).

### Impact

This attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH
implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These
algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a
consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH
implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to
downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH
extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable
attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle
(MitM) scenario.

### Man-in-the-middle attacker can compromise integrity of secure
channel in golang.org/x/crypto
[CVE-2023-48795](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48795) /
[GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8)
/ [GO-2023-2402](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2402)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A protocol weakness allows a MITM attacker to compromise the integrity
of the secure channel before it is established, allowing the attacker to
prevent transmission of a number of messages immediately after the
secure channel is established without either side being aware.

The impact of this attack is relatively limited, as it does not
compromise confidentiality of the channel. Notably this attack would
allow an attacker to prevent the transmission of the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO
message, disabling a handful of newer security features.

This protocol weakness was also fixed in OpenSSH 9.6.

#### Severity
Unknown

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[[CVE-2023-48795](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8 "CVE-2023-48795")](<https://togithub.com/warp-tech/russh/security/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8>)

### Summary

Terrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More
precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By
carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an
attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client
or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or
server noticing it.

### Mitigations

To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called
"strict kex" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a
Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as
well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.

**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this
countermeasure.**

As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected
algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until
patches are available.

### Details

The SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix
truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension
negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the
first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling
attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting
Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be
practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode.
Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit
previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle
scenario.

The attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of
SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently
removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange
has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the
excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence
numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial
key exchange.

In the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on
every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state
other than the message's sequence number. In the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC
cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using
this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR
and stream ciphers.

For more details see
[https://terrapin-attack.com](https://terrapin-attack.com).

### Impact

This attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH
implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These
algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a
consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH
implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to
downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH
extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable
attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle
(MitM) scenario.

### Man-in-the-middle attacker can compromise integrity of secure
channel in golang.org/x/crypto
[[CVE-2023-48795](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8 "CVE-2023-48795")](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48795>) /

/ [GO-2023-2402](<https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2402>)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A protocol weakness allows a MITM attacker to compromise the integrity
of the secure channel before it is established, allowing the attacker to
prevent transmission of a number of messages immediately after the
secure channel is established without either side being aware.

The impact of this attack is relatively limited, as it does not
compromise confidentiality of the channel. Notably this attack would
allow an attacker to prevent the transmission of the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO
message, disabling a handful of newer security features.

This protocol weakness was also fixed in OpenSSH 9.6.

#### Severity
Unknown

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2023-48795](https://togithub.com/warp-tech/russh/security/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8)

### Summary

Terrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More
precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By
carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an
attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client
or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or
server noticing it.

### Mitigations

To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called
\"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a
Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as
well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.

**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this
countermeasure.**

As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected
algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until
patches are available.

### Details

The SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix
truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension
negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the
first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling
attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting
Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be
practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode.
Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit
previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle
scenario.

The attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of
SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently
removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange
has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the
excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence
numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial
key exchange.

In the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on
every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state
other than the message's sequence number. In the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC
cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using
this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR
and stream ciphers.

For more details see
[https://terrapin-attack.com](https://terrapin-attack.com).

### Impact

This attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH
implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These
algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a
consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH
implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to
downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH
extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable
attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle
(MitM) scenario.

[GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8](https://togithub.com/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8)
/ [GO-2023-2402](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2402)

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A protocol weakness allows a MITM attacker to compromise the integrity
of the secure channel before it is established, allowing the attacker to
prevent transmission of a number of messages immediately after the
secure channel is established without either side being aware.

The impact of this attack is relatively limited, as it does not
compromise confidentiality of the channel. Notably this attack would
allow an attacker to prevent the transmission of the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO
message, disabling a handful of newer security features.

This protocol weakness was also fixed in OpenSSH 9.6.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2023-48795](https://togithub.com/warp-tech/russh/security/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8)

### Summary

Terrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More
precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By
carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an
attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client
or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or
server noticing it.

### Mitigations

To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called
\"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a
Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as
well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.

**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this
countermeasure.**

As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected
algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until
patches are available.

### Details

The SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix
truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension
negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the
first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling
attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting
Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be
practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode.
Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit
previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle
scenario.

The attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of
SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently
removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange
has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the
excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence
numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial
key exchange.

In the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on
every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state
other than the message's sequence number. In the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC
cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using
this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR
and stream ciphers.

### Impact

This attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH
implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These
algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a
consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH
implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to
downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH
extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable
attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle
(MitM) scenario.

### Man-in-the-middle attacker can compromise integrity of secure

[CVE-2023-48795](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48795) /

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A protocol weakness allows a MITM attacker to compromise the integrity
of the secure channel before it is established, allowing the attacker to
prevent transmission of a number of messages immediately after the
secure channel is established without either side being aware.

The impact of this attack is relatively limited, as it does not
compromise confidentiality of the channel. Notably this attack would
allow an attacker to prevent the transmission of the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO
message, disabling a handful of newer security features.

This protocol weakness was also fixed in OpenSSH 9.6.

#### Severity
Unknown

### Prefix Truncation Attack against ChaCha20-Poly1305 and
Encrypt-then-MAC aka Terrapin

#### Details
##### Summary

Terrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More
precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By
carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an
attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client
or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or
server noticing it.

##### Mitigations

To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called
\"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a
Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as
well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.

**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this
countermeasure.**

As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected
algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until
patches are available.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[[CVE-2023-48795](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8 "CVE-2023-48795")](<https://togithub.com/warp-tech/russh/security/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8>)

### Summary

Terrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More
precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By
carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an
attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client
or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or
server noticing it.

### Mitigations

To mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called
"strict kex" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a
Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as
well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.

**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this
countermeasure.**

As a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected
algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until
patches are available.

### Details

The SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix
truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension
negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the
first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling
attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting
Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be
practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode.
Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit
previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle
scenario.

The attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of
SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently
removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange
has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the
excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence
numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial
key exchange.

In the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on
every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state
other than the message's sequence number. In the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC
cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using
this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR
and stream ciphers.

For more details see
[https://terrapin-attack.com](https://terrapin-attack.com).

### Impact

This attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305
(chacha20-poly1305@&#8203;openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC
(*-etm@openssh.com), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH
implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These
algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of
Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a
consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH
implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to
downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH
extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable
attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle
(MitM) scenario.

<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

#### Details
A protocol weakness allows a MITM attacker to compromise the integrity
of the secure channel before it is established, allowing the attacker to
prevent transmission of a number of messages immediately after the
secure channel is established without either side being aware.

The impact of this attack is relatively limited, as it does not
compromise confidentiality of the channel. Notably this attack would
allow an attacker to prevent the transmission of the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO
message, disabling a handful of newer security features.

This protocol weakness was also fixed in OpenSSH 9.6.
