{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how TinyMCE's content insertion code handles iframe elements.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious iframe elements could execute when inserted into the editor, potentially triggering operations like downloading malicious assets. Although restricted by same-origin browser protections, the impact could still be significant.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Inserting malicious iframe elements into the editor's content."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to insert content into the TinyMCE editor. No special privileges are required, but user interaction to insert the malicious iframe is required."
  },
  "fix": "The vulnerability was addressed by introducing a new `sandbox_iframes` boolean option which adds the `sandbox=\"\"` attribute to every `iframe` element by default when enabled. This prevents cross-origin XSS and same-origin XSS by embedded resources. From TinyMCE 7.0.0 onwards the default value of this option is `true`. Additionally, a `sandbox_iframes_exclusions` option allows specifying domains that should be excluded from having the sandbox attribute applied.",
