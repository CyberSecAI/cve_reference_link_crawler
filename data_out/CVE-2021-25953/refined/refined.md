Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-25953:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `merge()` function of the `putil-merge` npm module. This function lacks proper validation of the input object's property types before assigning values. Specifically, it doesn't check if a property being assigned is a genuine property of the object or if it's part of the prototype chain (e.g., `__proto__`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:**  The primary weakness is a prototype pollution vulnerability. By including `__proto__` in the input, an attacker can modify the prototype of the Object, affecting all objects that inherit from it.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The absence of input validation on the properties passed to the `merge()` function enables this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be used to cause a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** It is also stated that it "may lead to remote code execution," though the document doesn't go into detail on how RCE would be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can supply a malicious payload to the `merge()` function. This payload will be crafted to include the `__proto__` property and the desired value to inject into the prototype.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `merge()` function.
- No special privileges are required, and the vulnerability can be exploited remotely. User interaction is also not required.

**Technical Details:**
The proof-of-concept (PoC) code provided clearly demonstrates how an attacker can pollute the Object prototype. The PoC uses `JSON.parse` to create a malicious object with a `__proto__` property, setting the property `polluted` to `"Polluted"`.  When this malicious object is merged with a regular object using `putil-merge` without validation the `polluted` property is added to the prototype. Any new object created after that point has the `polluted` property set to "Polluted"
```javascript
var putil_merge = require("putil-merge")

const payload = JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":"Polluted"}}');

var obj = {};

console.log("Before: " + obj.polluted);

putil_merge(obj, payload, {deep:true});

console.log("After: " + obj.polluted);

var obj_new =[]

console.log("obj_new also gets the polluted attribute with the value of " + obj_new.polluted)
```

**Affected Versions:**
- `putil-merge` versions 1.0.0 through 3.6.6 are affected.

**Fix:**
- Upgrade to version 3.7.0 or later.
