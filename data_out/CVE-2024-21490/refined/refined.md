The provided content relates to CVE-2024-21490.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a regular expression used to split the value of the `ng-srcset` directive. This regex is vulnerable to super-linear runtime due to backtracking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists due to a poorly crafted regular expression.
- The regex can cause catastrophic backtracking with large, crafted inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a large, carefully crafted input to the vulnerable regular expression.
- This leads to excessive CPU consumption, making the system inaccessible to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, allowing remote exploitation.
- The attacker provides a malicious input string that triggers the vulnerable regular expression.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to the vulnerable component which is accessible over a network.
