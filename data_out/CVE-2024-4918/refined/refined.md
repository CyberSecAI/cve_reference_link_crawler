Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4918:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `updateQuestion.php` file of the "Campcodes Online Examination System With Timer 1.0". The application directly incorporates user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter from the GET request, into an SQL query without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of input validation and sanitization. The `$id` parameter value is directly concatenated into the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data, potentially including user information and exam-related data.
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to complete database compromise.
- **Authentication bypass:** By manipulating the SQL query, an attacker could potentially bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `updateQuestion.php` page. The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the `id` parameter and the `updateQuestion.php` file to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is located in `updateQuestion.php`:
   ```php
   <?php
   include("../../../conn.php");
   $id = $_GET['id'];
   $selCourse = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM exam_question_tbl WHERE eqt_id='$id' ")->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
   ?>
   ```
- The provided SQLMap command demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability:
  ```
  python sqlmap.py -r 1.txt --current-user --batch --dbms mysql
  ```
- The `1.txt` file would contain the crafted HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker can use a payload such as `id=1'` or `id=1' UNION SELECT user(),database(),3-- -` to test the vulnerability.

The provided information gives details about a SQL Injection vulnerability present in the application.
