Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `formWriteFacMac` function of the Tenda FH1203 router firmware. The `mac` parameter, provided by the user, is directly passed to the `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization or validation, which allows the execution of arbitrary system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The lack of input sanitization of the `mac` parameter allows the attacker to inject shell commands within the MAC address field.
* **Direct Use of User Input:** User-supplied input is directly used in a system command without any filtering or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the router.
* **Full Control of the Device:** Command execution can lead to complete compromise of the device, including the ability to change settings, install backdoors, or use the router for malicious activities within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint.
* **`mac` Parameter:** The malicious commands are injected into the `mac` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface.
* **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:**  The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP POST requests.

**Additional Details:**
* **Affected Version:** Tenda FH1203 V2.0.1.6
* **Vulnerable Function:** `formWriteFacMac`
* **Vulnerable Parameter:** `mac`
* **Exploitation Method:** A simple HTTP POST request with the malicious command injected into the `mac` parameter. The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates this using a simple `echo 'hello'` command.
