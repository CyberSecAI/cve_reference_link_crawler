- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The All in One SEO plugin fails to properly validate and escape some of its post fields before outputting them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the affected post fields, which will then be executed in the browsers of users accessing the page containing the injected script (e.g. when an admin edits a post). This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a post with malicious JavaScript in the "Meta Description" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to WordPress. They also need to be able to create and save posts (either as drafts or submitted for review). The XSS payload is triggered when any user (like an administrator) edits the affected post.
