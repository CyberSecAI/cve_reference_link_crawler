Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Local File Read (LFR) issue present in the Session application. It arises from the application's handling of chat attachments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Read (LFR):** The application allows an attacker to read arbitrary local files on the user's device by crafting a specific file URI and sending it as a chat attachment.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The application does not sufficiently validate or sanitize file URIs included in chat attachments.
*   **Lack of User Consent:** The application does not request user consent before accessing and sharing files specified by a crafted URI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information, including internal application files (e.g., shared preferences containing configuration data) and public files from the user's device (e.g., images, downloads).
*   **Privacy Violation:** Sensitive data belonging to the user could be leaked to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Chat Attachments:** The primary attack vector is sending a specially crafted file URI as a chat attachment through the Session application.
*   **Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the victim's device can exploit the vulnerability by triggering the vulnerable activity in Session and passing a crafted file URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send chat messages to a target user using the Session application.
*   **Malicious Application (Optional):** The attacker can craft a malicious application to automate the exploit.
*   **Social Engineering (Optional):** The attacker may need to use social engineering techniques to persuade the victim to send the malicious attachment or to approve the sharing.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit code provided demonstrates how to create an intent that targets the `org.thoughtcrime.securesms.ShareActivity` activity of the `network.loki.messenger` application (Session), including a file URI that leads to the shared preferences file.
*   The use of `StrictMode.VmPolicy.LAX` allows the intent to access resources that would otherwise be restricted.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious intent is launched and Session tries to share the resource specified by the URI.

**Additional Information:**
*   The exploit does not automatically send the file to a specific contact, but it requires user interaction after a malicious contact has sent a malicious file URI or a malicious application is used to target the Session application.
* The vulnerability is present in version 1.17.5 and no patch is available yet.

**Summary of extracted information:**
The provided content details a local file read vulnerability in Session v1.17.5. By crafting a malicious file URI within a chat attachment, an attacker can access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive local files from the victim's device. The attack requires either user interaction after a malicious contact has sent a malicious file URI or a malicious application to be installed on the victim's device.
