- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, specifically CWE-79.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker could insert crafted input into various data fields in the affected web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to the vulnerable web interface. No authentication is required.
