Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3338

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Colibri Page Builder plugin when handling image alt text data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (image alt text), allowing malicious script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- The injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the malicious image.
- This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "image alt data parameter".
- An attacker injects malicious code into the image alt attribute via the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least author-level privileges within the WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Colibri Page Builder plugin up to and including version 1.0.262.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.0.264 with the addition of `esc_attr` to sanitize the $image_alt variable before it is inserted into the HTML.
