# Integer Overflow in C++ demangler logic

High

[XVilka](/XVilka)
published
GHSA-92h6-wwc2-53cq
Aug 19, 2023

## Package

rizin

## Affected versions

<=0.6.0

## Patched versions

0.6.1

## Description

### Impact

An integer overflow is present in `consume_count` function of `src/gnu_v2/cplus-dem.c` ([rz-libdemangle](https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-libdemangle) library), due to compiler optimizations removing the overflow check code. The compiler determines some parts of the function as unreachable and compile them out, however by doing so it removes an important overflow check. Users opening untrusted binary files that contain old (GCC 2) C++ mangling scheme might be affected.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in `rz-libdemangle` library

* [rizinorg/rz-libdemangle#54](https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-libdemangle/pull/54)
* [rizinorg/rz-libdemangle@51d0167](https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-libdemangle/commit/51d016750e704b27ab8ace23c0f72acabca67018)
* [#3753](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/pull/3753)

### Workarounds

A temporary workaround would be disabling C++ demangling using the configuration option `bin.demangle=false`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
