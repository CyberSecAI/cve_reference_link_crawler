Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8080

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `search.php` file of the SourceCodester Online Health Care System 1.0.
- The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `f_name` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, as user-controlled input is directly concatenated into a SQL query, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query's structure and logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, and disruption of service. An attacker could potentially gain access to the database, extract sensitive information, modify data, or even gain server access.
- **Database Exposure**: Attackers can use SQL injection to access the database and potentially steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or other private details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the `f_name` parameter in the `search.php` file.
- **HTTP POST Request**: Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
- **Understanding of SQL**: The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and injection techniques.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet in `search.php` is:
```php
$name=$_POST['f_name'];
$query1 = "SELECT * from doctor inner join schedule on schedule.d_id=doctor.id WHERE  (permission='approved' OR permission='Added') AND (f_name like'%$name%'  or f_name like'%$name%')";
$run = mysqli_query($db,$query1);
```
- The `$name` variable, derived directly from user input (`$_POST['f_name']`), is embedded into the SQL query without sanitization, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.
- **Proof of Concept (POC) Payload:**
`1%' or 1=1 ) UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,database(),7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23#`

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is considered easy to exploit.
- A public exploit is available, and technical details are known.
- The vulnerability is associated with MITRE ATT&CK T1505.
- There are no known countermeasures, and it is suggested to replace the affected product.

**In summary,** CVE-2024-8080 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in SourceCodester Online Health Care System 1.0. The lack of input sanitization allows a remote attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `f_name` parameter, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and system compromise.
