## Package

cmark-gfm
(None)

## Affected versions

< 0.29.0.gfm.6

## Patched versions

0.29.0.gfm.6

## Description

### Impact

A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm's autolink extension may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in `0.29.0.gfm.6`.

You may verify the patch by running `python3 -c 'print("![l"* 100000 + "\n")' | ./cmark-gfm -e autolink`, which will resource exhaust on unpatched `cmark-gfm` but render correctly on patched `cmark-gfm`.

### Workarounds

Disable use of the autolink extension.
