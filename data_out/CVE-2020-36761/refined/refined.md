Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36761:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content clearly identifies Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in multiple WordPress plugins and themes, including the "Top 10" plugin, which is the subject of CVE-2020-36761. The descriptions of vulnerable code snippets and the explanation of how the nonces are improperly checked directly relate to the core issue of CSRF vulnerabilities as described in the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary cause of the CSRF vulnerabilities is the improper or missing nonce validation. The code often checks for the existence of a nonce, but fails to verify it when the nonce is *not* set, or check it correctly,  allowing attackers to bypass security checks by not including the nonce parameter or by sending a zero value.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core vulnerability is the incorrect implementation of nonce checks. Instead of ensuring the presence and validity of a nonce before executing sensitive actions, the code often only checks if the nonce exists, leading to bypasses. Specifically, the following flawed logic patterns appear:
    *   Checking `isset($_POST['nonce']) && !wp_verify_nonce(...)` which means the nonce is only checked if it is set and the check is skipped if it's not.
    *   Checking `!isset($_POST['nonce']) && !wp_verify_nonce(...)` which means the nonce is only checked if it is not set which is a logical error.
    *   Checking `!empty($_POST['nonce']) && !wp_verify_nonce(...)` which means the nonce is only checked if it is set and not empty.
    *   Checking if a nonce is set or empty and performing actions when they are empty, while skipping the nonce check.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these CSRF vulnerabilities could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   **Data manipulation:** Attackers could modify data within the vulnerable plugin or theme's settings.
    *   **Settings changes:** Attackers could alter plugin or theme configurations.
    *   **Configuration import:** An attacker could import malicious configurations.
    *   **Privilege escalation:** In some cases, CSRF could be chained with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.
    *   **XSS injection:** Attackers may be able to inject malicious scripts by changing certain settings (stored XSS).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is primarily through social engineering.
    *   Attackers trick authenticated users (administrators) into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page. This link or page would contain a crafted request designed to exploit the vulnerability in the target plugin or theme.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs no access to the victim's WordPress system.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to trick a logged-in admin into clicking a link.

**3. Specific examples of vulnerable code:**

*   **Ocean Extra Plugin:**
    ```php
    if (!current_user_can('manage_options') || (isset($_REQUEST['_wpnonce'])&& !wp_verify_nonce($_REQUEST['_wpnonce'], 'oceanwp_options-options')))
    return;
    ```
     This code checks if the user has `manage_options` capability OR if the `_wpnonce` is set and invalid.  If `$_REQUEST['_wpnonce']` is not set, it bypasses the nonce check.
*   **EWWW Image Optimizer Plugin:**
    ```php
     if ( empty( $_REQUEST['ewww_wpnonce'] ) && ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_key( $_REQUEST['ewww_wpnonce'] ), 'ewww-image-optimizer-bulk' ) || ! current_user_can( $permissions ) )
    ```
     This code checks if the `ewww_wpnonce` is empty or invalid, and also checks user permissions. It skips the nonce check if it's not empty.
*   **Customizr Theme:**
    ```php
    if ( isset( $_POST['post_layout_noncename']) && !wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['post_layout_noncename'], plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) ) )
      return;
    ```
    This code verifies the nonce if `$_POST['post_layout_noncename']` is set. If the nonce is not set, the check is bypassed.
*   **Top 10 Plugin:** The provided code diff highlights a security fix where `isset` checks were removed from the nonce verification, addressing the CSRF issue.

**4. Remediation:**

*   The primary recommendation across all resources is to update the vulnerable plugins and themes to the latest versions.
*   The "Top 10" plugin's vulnerability was fixed in version 2.9.5, where the isset checks in the code were removed to properly enforce the nonce validation.
*   The blog posts also suggest using a web application firewall to get early warnings of these kinds of attacks.

**5. Additional Information:**

*   The blog posts from nintechnet.com provide a detailed look at numerous WordPress plugins and themes that suffer from similar CSRF issues.
*   The wordfence.com page confirms the vulnerability in the Top 10 plugin, and maps it to the specific CVE id.

**In Summary:**

CVE-2020-36761 describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability present in the "Top 10" WordPress plugin due to improper nonce validation, as well as in several other WordPress plugins and themes. An attacker could exploit this by tricking an authenticated admin user into making a request they did not intend. This could lead to data manipulation, settings changes, or even privilege escalation in some circumstances. The vulnerability is addressed by updating the plugin to version 2.9.5 or higher where the nonce checks are correctly implemented.
