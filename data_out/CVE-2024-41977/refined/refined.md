- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server component of the affected devices does not properly enforce isolation between user sessions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper session management, specifically the exposure of data elements to the wrong session. This is classified as CWE-488.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated remote attacker can escalate their privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access through the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account with low privileges and must be able to interact with the web interface. Additionally, user interaction is required (UI:R, or UI:A in CVSS v4.0).
