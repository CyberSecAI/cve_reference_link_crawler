**General Disclosure**

Security and performance is of the utmost importance to D-Link across all product lines. This is not just through the development process but also through regular firmware updates to comply with the current safety and quality standards. We are proactively working with the sources of these reports as well as continuing to review across the complete product line to ensure that the vulnerabilities discovered are addressed.  We will continue to update this page to include the relevant product firmware updates addressing these concerns. In the meantime, you can exercise the below cautions to avoid unwanted intrusion into your D-Link product.

**Immediate Recommendations for all D-Link router customers**

* Do not enable the *Remote Management* feature since this will allow malicious users to use this exploit from the internet.  *Remote Management* is default disabled on all D-Link Routers and is included for customer care troubleshooting if useful and the customer enables it.
* If you receive unsolicited e-mails that relates to security vulnerabilities and prompt you to action, please ignore it. When you click on links in such e-mails, it could allow unauthorised persons to access your router. Neither D-Link nor its partners and resellers will send you unsolicited messages where you are asked to click or install something.
* Make sure that your wireless network is secure.
* Do not provide your admin password to anyone. If required we suggest updating the password frequently.

**Description**

Please read the details from the author at: http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/csrf-unauthorized-remote-admin-access/

Details are left to  the authors original disclosure to avoid miscommunication and duplicaation of work and ownership. We offer the following as a summary pulled from the authors linked document.

The device is reported to have many CSRF vulnerabilities in its web configuration pages. The following are examples of exploits that can be performed on the product

* Add a new admin account (R/W access)
* Enable remote management of the router
* Send a ping to a machine controlled by the attacker (this way the attacker learns WAN IP of the router).

These and other exploits that may exist are due to improper configuration of the operating system, services, and scripts that run on the device. A new fimrware will be required to fix these issues.

> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | DIR-600 | Bx | v. 2.16WW and lower | v 2.17b02 Fixed |
