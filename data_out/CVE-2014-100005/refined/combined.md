How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SAP10018

DIR-600 - Rev. Bx - Web Configuration Pages have CSRF Vulnerabiliies - (F/W 2.16WW and lower)

**Publication ID:** SAP10018

**Resolved Status:** Open

**Published on:** 7 March 2014 9:10 GMT

**Last updated on:** 30 June 2014 9:05 GMT

**Overview**

The DIR-600 Rev. Bx F/W: 2.16WW and below router is susceptible to several CSRF attacks, which allow an attacker to forge HTML forms and execute actions in an authorized (logged in) browser session. These vulnerabilities allows an attacker, who has gained authorized access to the Web-GUI configration, the ability to change configuration or cause the product to be unreliable.

**D-Link Security Incident Reponse Policy**

All public communication on this issue will be offered at <http://securityadvisories.dlink.com/security/>

Our security response team can be contacted for incident information or to report incidents at security@dlink.com

Any non-critical security issue, help in updating firmware, or configuration regarding this issue please contact your D-Link Customer care channel.

**Reference**

Dawid Czagan - [Link](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/author/dawid-czagan/) -  Original Disclosure - [Link](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/csrf-unauthorized-remote-admin-access/)

**General Disclosure**

Security and performance is of the utmost importance to D-Link across all product lines. This is not just through the development process but also through regular firmware updates to comply with the current safety and quality standards. We are proactively working with the sources of these reports as well as continuing to review across the complete product line to ensure that the vulnerabilities discovered are addressed.  We will continue to update this page to include the relevant product firmware updates addressing these concerns. In the meantime, you can exercise the below cautions to avoid unwanted intrusion into your D-Link product.

**Immediate Recommendations for all D-Link router customers**

* Do not enable the *Remote Management* feature since this will allow malicious users to use this exploit from the internet.  *Remote Management* is default disabled on all D-Link Routers and is included for customer care troubleshooting if useful and the customer enables it.
* If you receive unsolicited e-mails that relates to security vulnerabilities and prompt you to action, please ignore it. When you click on links in such e-mails, it could allow unauthorised persons to access your router. Neither D-Link nor its partners and resellers will send you unsolicited messages where you are asked to click or install something.
* Make sure that your wireless network is secure.
* Do not provide your admin password to anyone. If required we suggest updating the password frequently.

**Description**

Please read the details from the author at: http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/csrf-unauthorized-remote-admin-access/

Details are left to  the authors original disclosure to avoid miscommunication and duplicaation of work and ownership. We offer the following as a summary pulled from the authors linked document.

The device is reported to have many CSRF vulnerabilities in its web configuration pages. The following are examples of exploits that can be performed on the product

* Add a new admin account (R/W access)
* Enable remote management of the router
* Send a ping to a machine controlled by the attacker (this way the attacker learns WAN IP of the router).

These and other exploits that may exist are due to improper configuration of the operating system, services, and scripts that run on the device. A new fimrware will be required to fix these issues.

**Affected Products**

> | Model Name | HW Version | Current FW Version | New FW Version for this exploit fix |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | DIR-600 | Bx | v. 2.16WW and lower | v 2.17b02 Fixed |

**Security patch for your D-Link router**

These firmware updates address the security vulnerabilities in affected D-Link routers. D-Link will update this continually and we strongly recommend all users to install the relevant updates.

As there are different hardware revisions on our products, please check this on your device before downloading the correct corresponding firmware update. The hardware revision information can usually be found on the product label on the underside of the product next to the serial number. Alternatively, they can also be found on the device web configuration.

To update the firmware please log-in to the Web-GUI interface of your device, from the menu select *Maintanence* -> *System* -> *Upgrade Firmware*. If you require help please contact your regional D-Link customer care website for options.
