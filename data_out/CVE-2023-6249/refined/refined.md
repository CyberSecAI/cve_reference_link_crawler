- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A signed integer `size` is converted to an unsigned integer when passed to `memcpy`. If `size` is negative, the unsigned conversion will result in a very large positive value, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer signedness error leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential buffer overflow leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, and other undefined behaviors. The CVSS score indicates high impact on integrity and availability and low impact on confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker can cause the size variable to be negative when calling esp32_ipm_send(), triggering the vulnerability when memcpy() copies more data than available in the destination buffer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access and the ability to control the `size` parameter of the `esp32_ipm_send` function. No special privileges or user interaction are required for exploitation.
