Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-22165:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability to create malformed Investigations within Splunk Enterprise Security. When a malformed investigation is created, it prevents the Investigations manager from being generated and rendered, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of investigation creation, which allows for the creation of malformed data that breaks the Investigations manager.
- Lack of input validation or sanitization when processing investigation creation requests, which allows an attacker to supply malicious data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, as the Investigations manager becomes unusable. This prevents security teams from accessing critical investigation data and managing security incidents effectively.
- **Loss of Functionality:** The inability to access the Investigations manager renders the investigation functionality unusable for most users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the creation of a malformed investigation via the Splunk Enterprise Security interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Session:** The attacker must have an authenticated session to Splunk Enterprise Security.
- **Access to Create Investigation:** The attacker needs the necessary permissions or roles that allow them to create Investigations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) versions lower than 7.1.2.
- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSSv3.1 score of 6.5.
- A Splunk detection rule is available for identifying exploitation attempts.
- The `splunkd_investigation_rest_handler` log is used to detect this vulnerability by looking for error statuses.
