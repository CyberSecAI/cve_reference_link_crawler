- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "reporting job editor" feature in ScienceLogic SL1 takes unsanitized user-controlled input and directly passes it to a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, as well as potential control of the underlying database. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged user with access to the "reporting job editor" feature can exploit the vulnerability.
