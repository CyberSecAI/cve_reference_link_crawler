Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-5764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Template Injection:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Ansible's internal templating operations. Specifically, these operations may incorrectly remove the "unsafe" designation from template data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Template Data:** The core issue is that internal templating processes within Ansible can mistakenly strip away the safety flags from template data, which can lead to injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Template Injection:** By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can introduce a template injection vulnerability. This could allow the attacker to inject malicious code or commands.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Depending on the context and injected code, the exploitation could lead to:
    *   **Disclosure of sensitive information:** An attacker may be able to access data not intended for them.
    *   **Addition or modification of data:** An attacker may be able to alter or add data.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker may be able to disrupt service availability

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Files:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted file that contains malicious template data.
*   **User-Supplied Templating Data:** The vulnerability arises when the system is processing user-supplied templating data, where the unsafe designation of the data is lost during the templating operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Templating Data:** An attacker needs to have the ability to provide template data to the Ansible controller. This often requires some level of access to the system or to a mechanism that allows data to be sent to the affected system.
*   **Local Access (NetApp):** According to NetApp's advisory, the attack vector has been identified as requiring local access, which implies the vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with local (system) access.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Products:** Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, Red Hat Ansible Inside, Red Hat Ansible Developer and NetApp ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in ansible-core versions 2.15.8, as well as other version updates to python3-galaxy-importer and python39-galaxy-importer.
*   **CVSS Score:** NetApp assigned a CVSS score of 7.8 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which indicates that the attack is a local one, requires low privileges, and has the potential to have a High impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-5764 is a template injection vulnerability in Ansible that occurs because the software can improperly remove the unsafe designation from template data. This vulnerability allows an attacker with the ability to provide template data to the ansible controller to inject code and potentially achieve data disclosure, modification, or denial of service.
