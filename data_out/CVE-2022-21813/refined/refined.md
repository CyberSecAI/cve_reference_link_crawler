Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-21813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux, specifically in the kernel driver.
*   It stems from improper handling of insufficient permissions or privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The driver fails to properly enforce permission checks, leading to a vulnerability.
*   **Limited Write Access to Protected Memory:** An unprivileged local user can gain limited write access to memory that should be protected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service. Although the provided text does not specify, this likely means the system would be rendered unstable, possibly crashing or hanging.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker does not need elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability; an unprivileged local user can trigger it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user on the system with the vulnerable driver installed.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-21813 describes a vulnerability in the Linux NVIDIA GPU Display Driver where improper privilege handling allows a local, unprivileged user to write to protected memory, potentially leading to a denial of service.
