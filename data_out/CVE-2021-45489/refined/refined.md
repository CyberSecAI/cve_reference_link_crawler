- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IP ID randomization was not enabled by default, and when enabled, the algorithms used for randomization were not strong enough. Additionally, there was an information leak in the TCP ISS random generation and the IPv6 flow label generation algorithm was weak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Weak IPv4 and IPv6 fragment ID generation due to not being randomly generated by default and using weak randomization algorithms when enabled.
    - Information leak in TCP Initial Sequence Number (ISS) random generation.
    - Weak IPv6 flow label generation algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Possible data exfiltration from firewalled or NATed networks by attackers who can predict IP IDs, TCP ISNs or IPv6 flow labels.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to observe network traffic to leverage predictable IP IDs, TCP ISNs, or IPv6 flow labels. This allows for potential data exfiltration.
