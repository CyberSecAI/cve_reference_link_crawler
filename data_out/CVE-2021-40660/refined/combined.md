I assume this can still be caught when setting an executor and max CPU time?  Yes.  The cause of the problem is the defect of the regular engine.

| Yes, such complex RegEx is vulnerable. Out of curiosity about the reason of injecting interruption call by using POISON\_PILLS, is this for the purpose of terminating script execution to cap cpu time? |

| Yes, it's injecting a bit of code that triggers the test for how much CPU time is used.  However, there is an additional fallback the sandbox provides, in that it can do a hard shutdown of the thread as well. But using the injected statements should be smoother. |

| [@mxro](https://github.com/mxro) How about remove all comment lines before run jsSanitizer? I have commented on a similar issue in the past. ( [#108](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-nashorn-sandbox/issues/108) )  I didn't know the exact reason such as ReDoS, but I knew that "POISONPIL + Comments" was the cause. So, I am using the logic to remove all comments in the code before eval(), and there has been no slowdown since then.  I don't know this approach is a real solution to this vulnerability, but I'm leaving a post in case it helps. |

| [@mxro](https://github.com/mxro) Yes, before call beautifyJs. but 2 Things must be clear. I think.  1 ) Does RemoveComments function completely remove all of comments line ? 2 ) it is necessary to confirm whether there is a need to change POISON\_PIL regular expression. |

| Modify the regular expression or split the regular logic, I think it's a better solution.Can you tell me more about what this regularity \n(?![\W]\*(//.+[\W]+)*else) means, and then we're trying to deal with it together?The \n(?![\W]*(//.+[\W]+)\*else) regular expression triggers a backtracking trap. |

| [@mxro](https://github.com/mxro) Hello, I'm sorry I won't submit open source code on GitHub. I can only communicate in this way.The above class can be used to break the infinite backtracking of regular expressions, and I've written a simple example you can refer to, and I think it can solve this problem.  ```     private static ThreadLocal<Integer> matchCount = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);  	String injectInterruptionCalls(final String str) { 		String perform = RemoveComments.perform(str); 		try { 			String current = perform; 			for (final PoisonPil pp : POISON_PILLS) { 				final StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(); 				final Matcher matcher = pp.pattern.matcher(new SecuInterruptibleCharSequence(current)); 				while (matcher.find()) { 					matcher.appendReplacement(sb, ("$1" + pp.replacement)); 				} 				matcher.appendTail(sb); 				current = sb.toString(); 			} 			return current; 		} catch (Exception exp) { 			return perform; 		} 	}  	static class SecuInterruptibleCharSequence implements CharSequence { 		CharSequence inner = "";  		public SecuInterruptibleCharSequence(CharSequence inner) { 			super(); 			this.inner = inner; 		}  		@Override 		public char charAt(int index) { 			matchCount.set(matchCount.get()+1); 			if (matchCount.get()>10000){ 				Thread thread = Thread.currentThread(); 				thread.interrupt(); 			} 			if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) { 				throw new ScriptCPUAbuseException("compile timeout Interrupted!", true, null); 			} 			return inner.charAt(index); 		}  		@Override 		public int length() { 			return inner.length(); 		}  		@Override 		public CharSequence subSequence(int start, int end) { 			return new SecuInterruptibleCharSequence(inner.subSequence(start, end)); 		}  		@Override 		public String toString() { 			return inner.toString(); 		} 	}  ```  Or you can use a separate thread, but I think you can use the sandbox to set the thread pool at build time.As follows:  ```     private static ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();  	String injectInterruptionCalls(final String str) { 		AtomicReference<String> current = new AtomicReference<>(RemoveComments.perform(str)); 		Future<String> submit = executorService.submit(() -> { 			for (final PoisonPil pp : POISON_PILLS) { 				final StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(); 				final Matcher matcher = pp.pattern.matcher(new SecuInterruptibleCharSequence(current)); 				while (matcher.find()) { 					matcher.appendReplacement(sb, ("$1" + pp.replacement)); 				} 				matcher.appendTail(sb); 				current.set(sb.toString()); 			} 			return current.get(); 		}); 		String result = null; 		try { 			result = submit.get(10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); 		} catch (Exception exp) { 			submit.cancel(true); 			result = current.get(); 		} 		return result; 	}  	static class SecuInterruptibleCharSequence implements CharSequence { 		CharSequence inner = "";  		public SecuInterruptibleCharSequence(CharSequence inner) { 			super(); 			this.inner = inner; 		}  		@Override 		public char charAt(int index) { 		 			if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) { 				throw new ScriptCPUAbuseException("compile timeout Interrupted!", true, null); 			} 			return inner.charAt(index); 		}  		@Override 		public int length() { 			return inner.length(); 		}  		@Override 		public CharSequence subSequence(int start, int end) { 			return new SecuInterruptibleCharSequence(inner.subSequence(start, end)); 		}  		@Override 		public String toString() { 			return inner.toString(); 		} 	}  ``` |

| Thank you [@MrLi2018](https://github.com/MrLi2018) for the further clarifications!  I've included this in PR [#139](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-nashorn-sandbox/pull/139). I would be very grateful for one or more reviews confirming this addresses the identified security issues. Thanks for [@SugarP1g](https://github.com/SugarP1g) for initially identifying this - I've tried to model the [unit test](https://github.com/javadelight/delight-nashorn-sandbox/pull/139/files#diff-c20d8172389408961754c6acd450a56d16b629accfbbe24f65008c9a5b065b96) as closely as possible to what you have submitted. |

| Thank you for your contribution to the sandbox, but another way is to use Hyperscan to parse regulars, because it's not a backtracking mechanism, but it seems that you need to modify the regulars, and if you want to remove the regulars, it seems that unless we can get involved in the JS loop itself.

| [@gregorywaynepower](https://github.com/gregorywaynepower) Yes, absolutely!  Not sure how I can get the CVE closed though?!  I can do some digging on how to update an existing [GitHub Security Advisory Contribution](https://github.com/github/advisory-database#contributions).  Edit: Looks like you can make a pull request to [this file](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/06/GHSA-38j3-6fm8-pfgc/GHSA-38j3-6fm8-pfgc.json) and add a `fixed` tag using [the Open Source Vulnerability format](https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/#format-overview). |
