  "CVE-2017-3241": {
    "description": "The RMI component of OpenJDK performed deserialization of untrusted inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of RMI registry or a Java RMI application. This issue was addressed by introducing whitelists of classes that can be deserialized by RMI registry or DCG. These whitelists can be customized using the newly introduced sun.rmi.registry.registryFilter and sun.rmi.transport.dgcFilter security properties.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the RMI component of OpenJDK performing deserialization of untrusted inputs, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
        "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of RMI registry or a Java RMI application, leading to a complete system compromise.",
     "attack_vector": "Network-based, specifically by supplying data to APIs in the RMI component without using Untrusted Java Web Start applications or Untrusted Java applets.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires the ability to supply malicious data to APIs in the RMI component. No specific user interaction is required beyond that."
