Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries. Java SE (JDK and JRE) versions below 6u132, 7u122, 8u113 are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to a takeover of Java, a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process. This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to a takeover of Java, a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process.
