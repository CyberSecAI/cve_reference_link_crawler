The provided content contains information about SQL injection vulnerabilities in LyLme\_spage v1.9.5, specifically mentioning CVE-2024-9788, CVE-2024-9789, and CVE-2024-9790. This response will focus on CVE-2024-9789 based on the provided information.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient input sanitization and filtering of user-supplied parameters, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities in multiple locations.
- Bypassing of implemented SQL injection filters.
- Vulnerable parameters: 'id' parameter in `/admin/tag.php`, `/admin/apply.php`, and `/admin/sou.php`.
- Use of `concat_ws` to bypass the filter on `group_concat`
- Ability to modify `LIMIT` clause to enumerate database content.
- Unrestricted SQL query execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the database.
- Ability to read sensitive data, including table names and data.
- Potential for complete database compromise.
- Potential to inject malicious SQL code.
- Possible execution of unauthorized operations on the database.
- Ability to induce delays using `sleep` function.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted HTTP requests with malicious SQL code injected into the 'id' parameter of the vulnerable URLs.
- The injection points are located at:
    - `/admin/tag.php`
    - `/admin/apply.php`
    - `/admin/sou.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is mentioned as being needed for the attack
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques.
- Ability to craft specific payloads to bypass the existing filters.
- Understanding of the application's structure and parameters.

The provided content contains more detail than a typical CVE description. It also includes proof-of-concept (POC) payloads, and examples demonstrating the ability to enumerate the database structure and introduce delays via sleep.
