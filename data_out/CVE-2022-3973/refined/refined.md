The provided content describes two SQL injection vulnerabilities in the HMS-PHP project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection in `adminlogin.php`
- SQL injection in `admin/admin.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, modifying data, or gaining control of the database. In the provided exploit examples, they can use techniques like blind SQL injection (using `SLEEP()`) and information extraction.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests to `/adminlogin.php` and `/admin/admin.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints. No other special privileges are required.
- They need to understand the vulnerable parameters in each case.
