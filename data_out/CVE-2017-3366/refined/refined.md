The provided document is a security advisory from Oracle, detailing the Critical Patch Update for January 2017. It includes a risk matrix that lists several CVEs addressed in the update, but it does not specify details about **CVE-2017-3366** itself.

However, it does indicate that CVE-2017-3366 is related to **Oracle Knowledge Management**, a subcomponent of **Oracle E-Business Suite**. It is also part of a group of CVEs that are addressed with a single patch (along with CVE-2017-3363, CVE-2017-3364, CVE-2017-3365, CVE-2017-3367).

The risk matrix entry for CVE-2017-3366 and the related CVEs is as follows:

*   **Component**: Oracle Knowledge Management
*   **Sub-component**: User Interface
*   **Protocol**: HTTP
*   **Remote Exploit without Auth.?**: Yes
*   **CVSS v3.0 Base Score:** 8.2
*   **Attack Vector:** Network
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low
*   **Privileges Required:** Required
*   **User Interaction:** None
*   **Scope:** Changed
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** High
*   **Integrity Impact:** Low
*   **Availability Impact:** None
*   **Supported Versions Affected:** 12.1.1, 12.1.2, 12.1.3

Based on this information:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The document doesn't explicitly state the root cause of the vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: There is a vulnerability in the User Interface of Oracle Knowledge Management that is accessible via HTTP. The high confidentiality impact and the low integrity impact indicates that this vulnerability is more likely a read-only disclosure issue rather than an injection or modification issue.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a high confidentiality impact (potentially exposing sensitive information) and a low integrity impact (potentially allowing for some changes or alterations of content, but not modification of the system). Availability is not directly affected.
*  **Attack Vectors**: Network-based attack via HTTP.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker can be remote and does not need authentication, but needs to be able to send HTTP requests.
