    "CVE": "CVE-2024-34727",
    "description": "A heap-buffer overflow vulnerability exists in `sdp_utils.cc`. Fuzzing identified a crash within `sdpu_compare_uuid_with_attr` due to an out-of-bounds comparison. Investigation suggests the root cause is a comparison of a 128-bit UUID with a discovery attribute of an invalid size. The fix includes added checks for discovery attribute size.",
