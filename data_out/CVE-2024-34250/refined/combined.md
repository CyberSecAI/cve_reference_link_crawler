| Subject of the issue Running the CLI iwasm with the given testcase results in a heap buffer overflow. Test case [iwasm-poc-01.zip](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/files/15073671/iwasm-poc-01.zip) Your environment ``` OS               : Linux 5.15.146.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Thu Jan 11 04:09:03 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Commit           : 7bdea3c2ae1f23683299c008bd5093ccaeb5f7b1 Version          : 2.0.0 Clang Verison    : 13.0.0 Affected Tool    : iwasm Enabled Features : None ``` Steps to reproduce ``` Build            : cd product-mini/platforms/linux/ && mkdir -p build && cd build && export CC="clang" CXX="clang++" CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -g" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -g" && cmake .. && make -j Command          : iwasm -f main iwasm-poc-01 ``` Expected behavior The program should exit gracefully with possibly some error information.
