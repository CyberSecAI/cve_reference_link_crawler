#### Modern Authentication for Email-based Approval

To enable modern authentication, click the Email Server Configuration settings on the Identity Console landing page, select the Modern Authentication radio button and specify the server settings you want to use for your SMTP e-mail server. For more information on how to configure modern authentication on your server, see [Authenticate the Server by Modern Authentication](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/identity-console/identity_console-admin/data/t4nvvyzc55do.html).
