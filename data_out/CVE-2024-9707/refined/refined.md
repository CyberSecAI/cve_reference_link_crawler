Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9707

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Hunk Companion plugin, up to version 1.8.4, has a missing authorization check on the `/wp-json/hc/v1/themehunk-import` REST API endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to access the function that is supposed to install and activate plugins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper capability checks on the vulnerable REST API endpoint. This means that anyone, including unauthenticated users, can send requests to this endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Plugin Installation/Activation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to install and activate any plugin they choose.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker installs and activates a vulnerable plugin, they can achieve remote code execution on the affected website.
- **Full Site Compromise:** By obtaining RCE, attackers could potentially gain complete control over the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated REST API Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/wp-json/hc/v1/themehunk-import` endpoint. This can be done from anywhere on the internet since no authorization is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any user credentials or prior access to the website.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.8.5 of the Hunk Companion plugin.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `hunk-companion/import/app/app.php` file. Specifically, the `register_routes()` function does not check if the user has the necessary permissions before registering the REST API routes.
- Wordfence reported blocking 13,672 attacks targeting this vulnerability in a 24-hour period, highlighting the critical nature and prevalence of exploitation attempts.
- The `permission_callback` for the `hc/v1/themehunk-import` route was set to `__return_true`, which effectively disables permission checks, making the endpoint accessible to everyone regardless of their authentication status.
- The `ai/v1/ai-site-import` route also had a `permission_callback` set to `__return_true`, but that route also requires a `login_user_id`, so an attacker can not directly abuse it.

This vulnerability is rated as critical due to the ease of exploitation and the potential for severe impact. Users of the Hunk Companion plugin are strongly advised to update to version 1.8.5 or later immediately.
