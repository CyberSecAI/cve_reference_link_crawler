- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the victim's browser when they interact with the crafted malicious content.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's storage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with low privileges can store the malicious payload, and another user with low privileges would trigger it by interacting with the stored content. The attacker needs to be able to write data to the application in a way that is later displayed to other users.
