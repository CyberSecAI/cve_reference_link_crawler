Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4487:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

*   The Wordfence content directly mentions `CVE-2024-4487` and states that the vulnerability is in the Blocksy Companion plugin <= 2.0.45. It describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of SVG uploads, and links to the relevant Trac changeset which confirms the mentioned vulnerability. Thus, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the Blocksy Companion plugin. This allows malicious code embedded within SVG files to be stored on the server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. This means the malicious scripts are stored within the database and are executed when users access pages or areas where these SVG files are rendered.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within a user's browser session. This can lead to a range of malicious activities including:
        *   Session hijacking
        *   Data theft
        *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
        *   Defacing the website
        *   Other client-side attacks

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SVG Upload:** Attackers inject malicious javascript through the upload of specially crafted SVG files to the WordPress media library through a vulnerable component.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need to be authenticated users with contributor-level permissions or higher. This means they need to have a valid user account on the WordPress site.
    *   **File Upload Access:** Attackers need to have the capability to upload media, specifically SVGs.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in the `framework/features/svg.php` file within the Blocksy Companion plugin.
*   The fix involved implementing sanitization of SVG content by adding a filtering function to `wp_handle_upload_prefilter`, specifically the `cleanup_svg` method which uses an external sanitizer library.

**4. Additional Information:**

* The provided content includes a changeset (`3084198`) which provides diffs for modified files, which also includes the `svg.php` file where the vulnerability was fixed.
* The changelog in the `readme.txt` mentions `Improvement: Sanitize all SVG images upon upload into media gallery` as a fix.
