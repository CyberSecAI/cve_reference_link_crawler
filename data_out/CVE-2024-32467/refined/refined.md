Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/product/user/special/ws/member/list/all` API endpoint. This endpoint lacks proper permission checks, allowing unauthorized users to access member information from workspaces they are not part of.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The core issue is the absence of proper authorization checks on the specified API endpoint. This allows users to bypass intended access restrictions.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** By manually changing the workspace ID in the request, an attacker can view member information from another workspace they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to member information of other workspaces.
*   **Confidentiality Violation:** This leak of information exposes potentially sensitive data, violating the confidentiality of workspace members.
*   **Limited Integrity/Availability Impact:** Although listed as having "Low" integrity and availability impacts, the primary impact is confidentiality. The low integrity impact implies a user is unlikely to be able to modify the data, and the low availability impact suggests the service remains accessible, even with the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out over a network, as the attacker needs to interact with the vulnerable API endpoint.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the workspace ID in the HTTP request sent to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account in the system (i.e., be logged in to the application).
*   **Workspace Membership:** The attacker must be a member of at least one workspace (but not necessarily the workspace for which member information will be revealed)
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to communicate with the application server.
*   **Knowledge of API endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable API endpoint.
*   **Ability to Modify HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept or modify the HTTP request to change the workspace ID.
*   **High Privileges required:** Although the attack allows for privilege escalation, it requires the attacker to already have "High" privileges in the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) clearly outlines the steps an attacker can take to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.7.
*   The fix is implemented in version `v2.10.14-lts`, with versions `<= v2.10.13-lts` being vulnerable.
