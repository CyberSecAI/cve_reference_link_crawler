Based on the provided information, all the content snippets relate to the same vulnerability fix in the Linux kernel's ath11k driver, where the MHI channel buffer length was decreased. This change addresses the following issue:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `buf_len` field in `ath11k_mhi_config_qca6390` was initially set to 0, which caused the MHI (Mobile Host Interface) to allocate a default buffer size of 64KB for channel buffers. In scenarios with high memory fragmentation or when memory compaction and reclaim are restricted, this large allocation size could fail.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Allocation Failure:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for memory allocation failure due to the large default buffer size (64KB) being requested by the MHI. This is exacerbated when the system memory is fragmented, or when memory compaction/reclaim is not possible.
- **Inefficient memory usage:** Allocating 64KB buffers when the largest packet size is less than 6KB is wasteful.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** If the memory allocation fails, the system can experience a kernel panic due to the inability to allocate memory. This is evidenced by the provided call trace in the kernel logs, showing a page allocation failure and resulting in a crash. The specific error is `page allocation failure: order:4, mode:0x40c00(GFP_NOIO|__GFP_COMP)`. This could cause system instability or denial of service.
- **System Instability:** Repeated memory allocation failures can also lead to general system instability, impacting the device's operability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The issue arises internally during the normal operation of the ath11k driver when it interacts with the MHI subsystem.
- Triggering the vulnerability requires an environment where system memory is highly fragmented, or memory compaction or reclaim is not allowed. The allocation failure is triggered during device resume when the `ath11k_core_resume` function is called.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker does not need any specific external access or control to trigger this. The vulnerability manifests under normal system operation. It is an internal issue within the kernel driver. It can happen due to specific memory configuration of a system. 

**Fix:**
The fix involves changing `buf_len` from 0 to 8192 (8KB). This reduces the buffer allocation size, decreasing the likelihood of allocation failure and saves memory, while still being large enough for normal QMI target -> host communication.
