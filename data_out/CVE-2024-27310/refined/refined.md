Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-27310

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by unsanitized LDAP queries during passwordless logins to ADSelfService Plus. This means the application does not properly validate or escape user-supplied input before using it in LDAP queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **LDAP Injection:** The primary vulnerability is LDAP injection due to the lack of sanitization of user input within LDAP queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized User Information Exposure:** An attacker could potentially extract unauthorized user information from the Active Directory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to overload the server by querying information for multiple users, leading to a denial-of-service attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the passwordless login functionality of ADSelfService Plus.
*   An attacker can inject malicious code into the input fields used for passwordless login, which are then used within unsanitized LDAP queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the passwordless login functionality of ADSelfService Plus.
*   The attacker must have some understanding of LDAP query syntax to craft malicious payloads.

**Affected Versions:**
*   ADSelfService Plus builds 6400 and earlier.

**Fixed Version:**
*   ADSelfService Plus build 6401.

**Fix Details:**
*   The fix involves sanitizing the LDAP queries sent to the ADSelfService Plus server, which prevents the injection of malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was reported by Nhien Pham through the Zoho BugBounty program.
* The vendor recommends updating to build 6401 or later to remediate the vulnerability.
