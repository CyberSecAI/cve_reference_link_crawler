Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the changes made in the commit `58f8b9941b53b606a1b15a4364005cd2b1965507`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit addresses a vulnerability related to password changes. Specifically, it prevents the user from setting their new password to the same value as the old password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Before the fix, the system allowed users to change their password to the same value, which is a weakness. This could potentially allow an attacker to reset a password to the original value, if they gained access to the change password function, with an old password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The potential impact of exploiting this vulnerability is low. If an attacker gained access to a user's password change functionality, they could potentially reset a user's password back to what it was before, but if they are already in the system, they likely have other avenues to achieve this. The fix prevents this scenario.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector would involve the user's account being compromised, and the attacker using the password change function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to:
1. Gain access to a user's profile.
2.  Be able to trigger the password reset function.
3.  Know the user's current password.

**Changes Made in Commit:**
*   **`system/controllers/users/forms/form_password.php`**: This file was modified to include a validation check to ensure that the new password is not the same as the old password.
*   **`system/languages/en/language.php`**: A new language string `ERR_NEW_PASS_AS_OLD` was added, which indicates that "The new password cannot be the same as the old password".
*  **`system/languages/ru/language.php`**: A new language string `ERR_NEW_PASS_AS_OLD` was added, which indicates that "Новый пароль не может быть таким же, как старый" in Russian.

**In summary:**
This commit addresses a potential weakness in the password change process where users could set their new password to the same as the old password. The fix introduces a new validation rule and error message to prevent this from occurring.
