- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has a broken access control issue, meaning that a function lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control due to missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable function and does not require any prior authentication or elevated privileges.
