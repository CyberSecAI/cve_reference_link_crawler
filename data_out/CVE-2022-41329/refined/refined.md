- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control allows unauthenticated access to static files containing logging information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information due to missing authentication checks on requests for static files. Specifically, the vulnerability is classified as CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can obtain sensitive logging information from the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can send crafted HTTP or HTTPS GET requests to the administrative interface of the vulnerable FortiOS or FortiProxy devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication and can be located remotely, as long as they can send network requests to the vulnerable device's administrative interface.
