* The Power Behind Sunhillo's Surveillance Products
* ASTERIX Validation, Filtering, and Modification
* Advanced Conversion and Filtering Capabilities
* Advanced Radar Plug-ins

Introduction
Additional Details

Introduction

**SureLine® Software Suite** is the backbone of Sunhillo Corporation’s surveillance gateway products ([RICI](https://www.sunhillo.com/product/rici-5000/), [Longport](https://www.sunhillo.com/product/longport/), [Brigantine SGP](https://www.sunhillo.com/product/brigantine-sgp/), [Ventnor](https://www.sunhillo.com/product/ventnor/), and [Margate II ADS-B](https://www.sunhillo.com/product/margate-ii-ads-b/)) and is the same codebase that was historically referred to as “COTS”. It provides a wide range of functionality including conversion, translation and other transforms that allow for bridging dissimilar networks, analyzing data and connecting surveillance sources to air-traffic automation systems.

**SureLine** **Software** is designed with an expandable layered architecture. The base layer on all SureLine products is “SureLine Core”. The proven architecture of SureLine Core and associated secure GUI allows easy configuration of complex data flows to route data between different frame formats and media. For applications that require custom integration, Core contains the MPS API connections. The MPS API connection provides a wide range of WAN radar protocols to a user developed application through the MPS development software kit.

Features can be added to the Core to open additional functionality. Basic features are included in our SureLine Tier 1 and 2 licenses while more advanced features can be added individually.

Additional Details

The Tier mechanism extends **SureLine** Core to include a wealth of radar format conversions, with more than 400 possible conversion combinations, ASTERIX validation, filtering capabilities and visualizations. Tier 1 and 2, support opens the door for other advanced features that can be loaded or licensed individually such as radar trackers, fusers and advanced MPS API protocols.

Through the web-enabled graphical user interface (GUI), SureLine Core offers a seamless user interface experience across all associated platforms reducing training requirements.

**SureLine** is constantly evolving to meet the demands of the ever-rising security bar. The security features built in to SureLine are derived from the ISO/IEC 15408 Common Criteria (CC) Network Device Protection Profile (NDPP).

## SureLine Web GUI

Not a programmer? No problem! The SureLine Web GUI requires no coding experience to configure a SureLine product.

SureLine’s Web GUI is easily configurable with drag and drop functionality. The drag and drop feature makes updating a configuration or setting up the products for the first time simple and intuitive. The Web GUI is universal across all SureLine Products which includes the RICI 5000, Longport, Ventnor, Margate II ADS-B, and the Brigantine Surveillance Gateway Processor (SGP). No additional training is required when using multiple products that run on SureLine software.

* Drag & Drop Configurations
* Web Based
* Extensive feature-set, high-level performance
* Universal across SureLine Products
