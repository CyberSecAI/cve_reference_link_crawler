### More info

The **biggest problem** of Prestashop sites containing **many combinations** and a significant penalty because of the loading of the products pages which can be **very long** because of a weight of data too important, it is even possible that the **customers leave** without having seen the less information, it is estimated that if nothing is displayed after **3 seconds**, the majority of customers leave the site, more annoying, when **search engines** browse your site, too long **lead to a penalty** of pages repressing these last beyond the first page to see further, while we know that a good number of people do not go beyond the **fifth result**, which is half of the first page.

This problem will finally be a thing of the past thanks to the **optimized combinations module**.

This module allows to set the **number of combinations to load in the product display** and **optimize combinations generator** of PrestaShop and raises the limit to about 3000 maximum combinations.

The display of combinations in administration is also cut with a pagination to **improve its loading time**.

On the product page, only some of the existing combinations is loaded on the product page display, thus reducing at the maximum its duration.

When a customer changes an attribute, if the resulting combination is not loaded, the module do it and displayed the right informations.

Be carreful! The module can work correctly if combinations have been generated via the Prestashop generator.

Links to download the documentations of the module are available at the bottom of the page.

**Prestashop compatible versions**

1.5 & 1.6

**Module version**

0.1.3

[Friends-Of-Presta Security Advisories](/)

[Cybersecurity Glossary](/glossary/)[About](/about/)

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

# [CVE-2023-33666] Improper neutralization of a SQL parameter in aioptimizedcombinations from ai-dev module for PrestaShop

Aug 3, 2023
• #modules • critical (9.8) •
202-ecommerce.com,
TouchWeb.fr,
Friends-Of-Presta.org

In the module “Opimized combinations” (aioptimizedcombinations) for PrestaShop, an attacker can perform a SQL injection up to 0.1.2. Release 0.1.3 fixed this security issue.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-33666](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-33666)
* **Published at**: 2023-08-03
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta.org
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: aioptimizedcombinations
* **Impacted release**: <= 0.1.2 (0.1.3 fixed issue)
* **Product author**: ai-dev
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

Up to 0.1.3, a sensitive SQL call in file `includes/ajax.php` can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a blind SQL injection throught the POST or GET submitted `attributes` variables.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Technical and personal data leaks
* Obtain admin access
* Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
* Display sensitives tables to front-office to unlock potential admin’s ajax scripts of modules protected by token on the ecosystem

## Patch

```
--- a/modules/aioptimizedcombinations/includes/ajax.php
+++ b/modules/aioptimizedcombinations/includes/ajax.php
switch (Tools::getValue('action'))
{
	case 'getCombination' :
		/* If no product or combination, we quit */
		if (!Tools::getIsset('product') || !Tools::getIsset('attributes'))
			die();

		$attributes = explode(',', Tools::getValue('attributes'));

		/* Get combination id */
		$combination_data = Db::getInstance()->getRow(
			'SELECT COUNT(*) as number, pa.id_product_attribute FROM '._DB_PREFIX_.'product_attribute AS pa LEFT JOIN '._DB_PREFIX_.'product_attribute_combination AS pac ON pa.id_product_attribute = pac.id_product_attribute WHERE pa.id_product = '.
-			(int)Tools::getValue('product').' AND pac.id_attribute IN ('.pSQL(Tools::getValue('attributes')).') GROUP BY pa.id_product_attribute HAVING number = '.count($attributes)
+			(int)Tools::getValue('product').' AND pac.id_attribute IN ('.implode(',', array_map('intval', explode(',', Tools::getValue('attributes')))).') GROUP BY pa.id_product_attribute HAVING number = '.count($attributes)
		);

```
## Other recommandations

* + To help improve the security of your PrestaShop installation, we recommend upgrading to the latest version. One of the benefits of upgrading is that it will disable the use of multiquery executions (separated by semicolons). However, please be aware that this **will not protect** your shop against SQL injection attacks that use the UNION clause to steal data. Additionally, it’s important to note that PrestaShop includes a function called pSQL, which includes a strip\_tags function. This helps protect your shop against [Stored XSS (also known as XSS T2) of Category 1](https://security.friendsofpresta.org/modules/2023/02/07/stored-xss.html). If a pSQL function is missing, it could potentially expose your project to critical Stored XSS vulnerabilities due to edge cases. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that all relevant functions are properly implemented and used consistently throughout your project.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.
