The provided content is related to a commit that addresses security vulnerabilities, specifically:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The commit message states "Fix: Sanitizing HTML inputs and Cors misconfiguration"
- The code changes show sanitization of user inputs to prevent XSS and CORS configuration to restrict origin access.
  -  Specifically, the `MessageInput.svelte` file now uses `DOMPurify.sanitize()` to sanitize the user input and `escapeHTML()` to escape HTML characters, before sending messages.
  -  The `devika.py` file has a change in the CORS configuration to explicitly set allowed origins `CORS(app, resources={r"/*": {"origins": ["https://localhost:3000"]}})`.
- Additionally, the `project.py` file now uses `secure_filename` to sanitize project names in API endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application was vulnerable to XSS through user-provided HTML input that was not properly sanitized, allowing execution of malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser.
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration: The application had a permissive CORS policy, which could allow unauthorized access to the application's API from untrusted origins.
- Unsanitized filenames: Project names provided via API endpoints were not being sanitized before being used to form paths which could lead to path traversal or other filesystem-based attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- XSS: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application that could steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
- CORS misconfiguration: An attacker could make requests to the application's API from a malicious website or origin potentially leading to data exfiltration or other unauthorized actions.
- Unsanitized Filenames: An attacker could craft a malicious project name to gain access to the file system by navigating up the directory tree or performing other filesystem related exploits.

**Attack vectors:**
- XSS: A user could input malicious HTML/JavaScript code through the message input field.
- CORS misconfiguration: An attacker could host a malicious website and make requests to the application's API.
- Unsanitized filenames: An attacker could use the create project or other project based api endpoints to create or manipulate filesystem files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- XSS: The attacker would need to be able to input malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the message input field, which is accessible to any user.
- CORS misconfiguration: The attacker would need to be able to host a website or control an origin that can make requests to the application's API.
- Unsanitized filenames: The attacker would need to be able to make api calls to the project endpoints.
