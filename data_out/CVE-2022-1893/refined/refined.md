The provided content relates to a commit in the `trudesk` repository that introduces a fix related to image data removal. Specifically, it adds a call to `stripExifData` function for uploaded files with `.jpg` or `.jpeg` extensions. This function is likely intended to remove EXIF metadata from image files.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit addresses a potential issue where uploaded image files could contain EXIF data, which might include sensitive information or potentially be used for malicious purposes. The vulnerability is related to the lack of sanitization of user-uploaded images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of EXIF Data Stripping:** Before the fix, the application didn't remove EXIF data from uploaded JPEG images, potentially exposing metadata embedded within the images. This could include location information, camera settings, and potentially personally identifiable information, creating a privacy risk.
- **Potential for Malicious EXIF:** While not directly discussed in the commit, there's a general risk that attackers could craft images with malicious EXIF data to trigger vulnerabilities in image processing libraries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive metadata contained in EXIF data like location data, potentially revealing private information about the user who uploaded the image or where the photo was taken.
- **Potential for Client-Side Attacks:** Although not directly stated in the provided content, there's a possibility of malicious EXIF data being used in a client-side attack, depending on the application's handling of EXIF and image rendering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Upload of Malicious Images:** An attacker could upload a specially crafted image with malicious EXIF data to the application, bypassing previous security measures.
- **Social Engineering:** Users might be tricked into uploading images with embedded sensitive data, unaware that the information is being stored and potentially accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to upload image files to the `trudesk` application. This likely implies having an account with sufficient privileges to upload favicons, logos or page logos.
- No special skills beyond the ability to upload images and potentially create a malicious image with EXIF data is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit modifies `src/controllers/main.js`, where upload functionality for favicons, logos, and page logos resides.
- The fix specifically targets `.jpg` and `.jpeg` files for EXIF stripping.
- The `stripExifData` function is located in the `../helpers/utils` file, suggesting a helper utility to be used when handling images.
