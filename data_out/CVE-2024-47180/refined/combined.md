Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version < `server-2024-09-25` are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the JSONPath library used by the Dynamic JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request to a URL on the instance the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression. All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable.

### Patches

This problem was fixed in PR [#10551](https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/10551) . Self-hosting users should upgrade immediately.

If you follow the tagged releases, update to `server-2024-09-25` or later.

If you follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to the latest version.

### Workarounds

The best way to resolve this issue is by upgrading to a fixed version. However blocking access to the endpoints

* `/badge/dynamic/json`
* `/badge/dynamic/toml`
* `/badge/dynamic/yaml`

(e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed.

| We've just published a critical security advisory relating to a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Dynamic JSON/TOML/YAML badges: [GHSA-rxvx-x284-4445](https://github.com/badges/shields/security/advisories/GHSA-rxvx-x284-4445 "GHSA-rxvx-x284-4445") Thanks to [@nickcopi](https://github.com/nickcopi) for his help with this.  If you self-host your own instance of Shields you should upgrade to [server-2024-09-25](https://hub.docker.com/layers/shieldsio/shields/server-2024-09-25/images/sha256-28aaea75049e325c9f1d63c8a8b477fc387d3d3fe35b933d6581487843cd610f?context=explore) or later as soon as possible to protect your instance.  This is primarily a concern for self-hosting users. However this does also have a couple of knock-on implications for some users of shields.io itself. 1. Users who have authorized the Shields.io GitHub OAuth app While we have taken steps to close this vulnerability quickly after becoming aware of it, this attack vector has existed in our application for some time. We aren't aware of it having been actively exploited on shields.io. We also can't prove that it has not been exploited.  We don't log or track our users, so a breach offers a very limited attack surface against end users of shields.io. This is by design. One of the (few) information assets shields.io does hold is our GitHub token pool. This allows users to share a token with us by authorizing our OAuth app. Doing this gives us access to a token with read-only access to public data which we can use to increase our rate limit when making calls to the GitHub API.  The tokens we hold are not of high value to an attacker because they have read-only access to public data, but we can't say for sure they haven't been exfiltrated. If you've donated a token in the past and want to revoke it, you can revoke the Shields.io OAuth app at <https://github.com/settings/applications> which will de-activate the token you have shared with us. 2. Users of Dynamic JSON/TOML/YAML badges Up until now, we have been using <https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath> as our library querying documents using JSONPath expressions. [@nickcopi](https://github.com/nickcopi) responsibly reported to us how a prototype pollution vulnerability in this library could be exploited to construct a JSONPath expression allowing an attacker to perform remote code execution. This vulnerability was reported on the package's issue tracker but not flagged by security scanning tools. It seems extremely unlikely that this will be fixed in the upstream package despite being widely used. It also seems unlikely this package will receive any further maintenance in future, even in response to critical security issues. In order to resolve this issue, we needed to switch to a different JSONPath library. We've decided to switch <https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath> using the `eval: false` option to disable script expressions.  This is an important security improvement and we have to make a change to protect the security of shields.io and users hosting their own instance of the application. However, this does come with some tradeoffs from a backwards-compatibility perspective. Using `eval: false` Using JSONPath-Plus with `eval: false` does disable some query syntax which relies on evaluating javascript expressions.  For example, it would previously have been possible to use a JSONPath query like `$..keywords[(@.length-1)]` against the document <https://github.com/badges/shields/raw/master/package.json> to select the last element from the keywords array   [shields/package.json](https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/e237e40ab88b8ad4808caad4f3dae653822aa79a/package.json#L6-L12)  Lines 6 to 12 in [e237e40](/badges/shields/commit/e237e40ab88b8ad4808caad4f3dae653822aa79a)   |  | "keywords": [ | | --- | --- | |  | "GitHub", | |  | "badge", | |  | "SVG", | |  | "image", | |  | "shields.io" | |  | ], |      This is now not a supported query.  In this particular case, you could rewrite that query to `$..keywords[-1:]` and obtain the same result, but that may not be possible in all cases. We do realise that this removes some functionality that previously worked but closing this remote code execution vulnerability is the top priority, especially since there will be workarounds in many cases. Implementation Quirks Historically, every JSONPath implementation has had its own idiosyncrasies. While most simple and common queries will behave the same way across different implementations, switching to another library will mean that some subset of queries may not work or produce different results.  One interesting thing that has happened in the world of JSONPath lately is RFC 9535 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535> which is an attempt to standardise JSONPath. As part of this mitigation, we did look at whether it would be possible to migrate to something that is RFC9535-compliant. However it is our assessment that the JavaScript community does not yet have a sufficiently mature/supported RFC9535-compliant JSONPath implementation. This means we are switching from one quirky implementation to another implementation with different quirks.  Again, this represents an unfortunate break in backwards-compatibility. However, it was necessary to prioritise closing off this remote code execution vulnerability over backwards-compatibility.  Although we can not provide a precise migration guide, here is a table of query types where <https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath> and <https://github.com/JSONPath-Plus/JSONPath> are known to diverge from the consensus implementation. This is sourced from the excellent <https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/> While this is a long list, many of these inputs represent edge cases or pathological inputs rather than common usage.  Table  | Query Type | Example Query | | --- | --- | | Array slice with large number for end and negative step | `$[2:-113667776004:-1]` | | Array slice with large number for start end negative step | `$[113667776004:2:-1]` | | Array slice with negative step | `$[3:0:-2]` | | Array slice with negative step on partially overlapping array | `$[7:3:-1]` | | Array slice with negative step only | `$[::-2]` | | Array slice with open end and negative step | `$[3::-1]` | | Array slice with open start and negative step | `$[:2:-1]` | | Array slice with range of 0 | `$[0:0]` | | Array slice with step 0 | `$[0:3:0]` | | Array slice with step and leading zeros | `$[010:024:010]` | | Bracket notation with empty path | `$[]` | | Bracket notation with number on object | `$[0]` | | Bracket notation with number on string | `$[0]` | | Bracket notation with number -1 | `$[-1]` | | Bracket notation with quoted array slice literal | `$[':']` | | Bracket notation with quoted closing bracket literal | `$[']']` | | Bracket notation with quoted current object literal | `$['@']` | | Bracket notation with quoted escaped backslash | `$['\\']` | | Bracket notation with quoted escaped single quote | `$['\'']` | | Bracket notation with quoted root literal | `$['$']` | | Bracket notation with quoted special characters combined | `$[':@."$,*\'\\']` | | Bracket notation with quoted string and unescaped single quote | `$['single'quote']` | | Bracket notation with quoted union literal | `$[',']` | | Bracket notation with quoted wildcard literal ? | `$['*']` | | Bracket notation with quoted wildcard literal on object without key | `$['*']` | | Bracket notation with spaces | `$[ 'a' ]` | | Bracket notation with two literals separated by dot | `$['two'.'some']` | | Bracket notation with two literals separated by dot without quotes | `$[two.some]` | | Bracket notation without quotes | `$[key]` | | Current with dot notation | `@.a` | | Dot bracket notation | `$.['key']` | | Dot bracket notation with double quotes | `$.["key"]` | | Dot bracket notation without quotes | `$.[key]` | | Dot notation after recursive descent with extra dot ? | `$...key` | | Dot notation after union with keys | `$['one','three'].key` | | Dot notation with dash | `$.key-dash` | | Dot notation with double quotes | `$."key"` | | Dot notation with double quotes after recursive descent ? | `$.."key"` | | Dot notation with empty path | `$.` | | Dot notation with key named length on array | `$.length` | | Dot notation with key root literal | `$.$` | | Dot notation with non ASCII key | `$.??` | | Dot notation with number | `$.2` | | Dot notation with number -1 | `$.-1` | | Dot notation with single quotes | `$.'key'` | | Dot notation with single quotes after recursive descent ? | `$..'key'` | | Dot notation with single quotes and dot | `$.'some.key'` | | Dot notation with space padded key | `$. a` | | Dot notation with wildcard after recursive descent on scalar ? | `$..*` | | Dot notation without dot | `$a` | | Dot notation without root | `.key` | | Dot notation without root and dot | `key` | | Empty | `n/a` | | Filter expression on object | `$[?(@.key)]` | | Filter expression after dot notation with wildcard after recursive descent ? | `$..*[?(@.id>2)]` | | Filter expression after recursive descent ? | `$..[?(@.id==2)]` | | Filter expression with addition | `$[?(@.key+50==100)]` | | Filter expression with boolean and operator and value false | `$[?(@.key>0 && false)]` | | Filter expression with boolean and operator and value true | `$[?(@.key>0 && true)]` | | Filter expression with boolean or operator and value false | `$[?(@.key>0 &#124;&#124;
