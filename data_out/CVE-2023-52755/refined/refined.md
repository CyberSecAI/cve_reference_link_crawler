### CVE-2023-52755

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A slab out-of-bounds write occurs in the `smb_inherit_dacl()` function within the ksmbd module.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that offsets used to access memory within the `pntsd` structure can be larger than the allocated size of the structure. Specifically, the offsets `pntsd->osidoffset`, `pntsd->gsidoffset`, and `pntsd->dacloffset`, when combined with their respective sizes, were not checked against the allocated size (`pntsd_alloc_size`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An out-of-bounds write to a slab memory region can lead to corruption of kernel memory, potentially causing a system crash or allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the `smb_inherit_dacl()` function, suggesting it is related to SMB operations involving inheritance of Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to trigger the execution path in the `smb_inherit_dacl()` function where the vulnerable offsets are calculated and used. This likely involves manipulating SMB requests related to DACL inheritance.
- The attacker likely needs to be a user that can interact with the SMB server.

**Additional Details:**
- The patch addresses this issue by adding checks to validate that the calculated offsets (`pntsd->osidoffset`, `pntsd->gsidoffset`, and `pntsd->dacloffset`) plus the size of the data they point to do not exceed the allocated size of `pntsd`. If any of these checks fail, the function returns an error and frees the allocated `pntsd` memory to prevent out-of-bounds write.
- The vulnerability is identified by ZDI-CAN-22271.
- The fix is present in multiple stable kernel branches.
- The vulnerable code is in `fs/smb/server/smbacl.c` in some branches and `fs/ksmbd/smbacl.c` in others.
