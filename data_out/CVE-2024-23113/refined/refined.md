Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a format string bug in the `fgfmd` daemon of FortiOS. The daemon uses an externally-controlled string as a format string, which leads to the vulnerability.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is a format string vulnerability ([CWE-134](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html)). This occurs when user-supplied data is used as a format string in functions like `printf`, `sprintf`, etc., without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or commands on the affected system. This could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated. The attacker can send specially crafted requests to the vulnerable `fgfmd` daemon to trigger the format string vulnerability.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to a vulnerable FortiOS instance. No authentication is required for a successful exploit.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

The following products and versions are affected:

*   **FortiOS:**
    *   7.4.0 through 7.4.2
    *   7.2.0 through 7.2.6
    *   7.0.0 through 7.0.13
*   **FortiPAM:**
    *   1.2 all versions
    *   1.1 all versions
    *   1.0 all versions
*   **FortiProxy:**
    *   7.4.0 through 7.4.2
    *   7.2.0 through 7.2.8
    *   7.0.0 through 7.0.15
*   **FortiSwitchManager:**
     * 7.2.0 through 7.2.3
     * 7.0.0 through 7.0.3

**Workarounds:**

*   Remove fgfm access on interfaces.  For example, removing `fgfm` from `set allowaccess` for each interface.
*   While a local-in policy that only allows FGFM connections from a specific IP may reduce the attack surface, it won't prevent exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was internally discovered and reported by Fortinet's Product Security team.
*   The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSSv3 score of 9.8.
*   The vulnerability has been potentially exploited in the wild.
