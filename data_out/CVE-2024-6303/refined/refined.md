      "details": "The changelog for Conduit v0.8.0 mentions a critical vulnerability requiring an attacker to have an account on the server. It advises administrators with untrusted users to update immediately or take their homeserver offline. The vulnerability can be checked by sending `@conduit:server.name: help` in the admin room.
