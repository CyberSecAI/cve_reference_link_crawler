- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The IBM LKS Administration Reporting Tool and its Agent are vulnerable to stored XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the application, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected application, leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious scripts can be injected through the application's user input fields or any other mechanism that allows persistent data storage, and then the injected scripts will execute when an application user views the manipulated data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious code into the affected application's storage. The attacker must have access to an input method that the application does not sanitize to allow the malicious script injection.
