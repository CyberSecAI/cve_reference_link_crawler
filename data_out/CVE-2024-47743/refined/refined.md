Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `find_asymmetric_key()` function in `crypto/asymmetric_keys/asymmetric_type.c` had a flaw where it would dereference `id_2` without properly checking if it was NULL, after an initial check for all three IDs being NULL. This would occur if `id_0` and `id_1` were NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL pointer dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the potential dereference of a NULL pointer (`id_2`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash (oops):** Dereferencing a NULL pointer in kernel space results in a kernel oops, leading to a system crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by passing NULL values for `id_0`, `id_1`, and `id_2` to the `find_asymmetric_key()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to call the `find_asymmetric_key()` function with crafted input where all id parameters are NULL. This could occur through various interfaces that utilize this function, depending on how the key subsystem is used by the system.

**Additional Details**
- The fix involves adding a check to see if `id_2` is NULL, and if so, it returns `-EINVAL` and also moves the initial `WARN_ON` to the final `else` branch. This prevents the NULL dereference and improves the logical flow of the code.
- The vulnerability was found by the Linux Verification Center using the Svace static analysis tool.
- The fix has been backported to various stable kernel versions starting from v5.17.
