Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is **improper permission management** in Disconf version 2.6.36. Specifically, the application does not require authentication to access certain API endpoints that expose sensitive configuration data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The `/api/config/list`, `/api/config/simple/list`, `/api/config/item`, and `/api/config/file` endpoints can be accessed without any authentication.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This lack of authentication allows unauthorized users to retrieve sensitive configuration information, including parameter names, values, and even entire configuration files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Attackers can obtain configuration data, which may contain credentials (e.g., database passwords, API keys), potentially leading to further attacks.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** If the configuration data includes critical system or application information, it could lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending unauthenticated HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Disconf server.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know or guess the API endpoints (`/api/config/list`, `/api/config/simple/list`, `/api/config/item`, `/api/config/file`).
*   **Parameter Guessing:** The attacker must guess or brute-force the `app` parameter. The `env` parameter is limited to four known values, and the `version` and `key` parameters can be guessed by convention.

**Specific Vulnerable Endpoints and Parameters:**

*   `/api/config/list`: Returns all parameters and their values for a given app, env, and version.
*   `/api/config/simple/list`: Returns all parameters (without values) for a given app, env, and version.
*   `/api/config/item`: Returns the value of a specific parameter for a given app, env, and version.
*  `/api/config/file`: Returns the content of a configuration file for a given app, env, and version.
*  Parameters:
    * app: Application name (can be guessed)
    * env: Environment (rd, qa, local, online)
    * version: Configuration version (can be guessed)
    * key: Parameter name (can be guessed), used in `/api/config/item` and `/api/config/file`

**More Detail than CVE:**

*   The provided content gives a more detailed breakdown of the vulnerable endpoints, parameters, and proof of concept requests than the placeholder CVE description.
*   The content includes images of successful exploitation of the endpoints showing the responses received by the attacker.
*   The content clarifies that the attacker may need to brute-force or guess certain parameters.

**Summary**

Disconf 2.6.36 suffers from an improper authentication vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive configuration data by sending specially crafted requests to vulnerable API endpoints. The vulnerability can be exploited easily once the attacker has network access.
