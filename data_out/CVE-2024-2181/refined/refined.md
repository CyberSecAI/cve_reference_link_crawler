Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Beaver Builder Addons by WPZOOM" plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the Button widget was vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, particularly within the Button widget. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. When a page containing the vulnerable button is loaded, the injected script executes in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in pages where the vulnerable button is present.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin:** The vulnerability resides within the "Beaver Builder Addons by WPZOOM" plugin.
- **Button Widget:** The specific attack vector involves the Button widget of the plugin.
- **Input Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into input fields of the Button widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated.
- **Contributor+ Access:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to modify content using the plugin.
- **Knowledge:** Basic understanding of XSS vulnerabilities is required to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.3.4.
- The fix was included in version 1.3.5, which implemented proper input sanitization using `esc_url`, `esc_attr`, and `wp_kses_post` functions on potentially vulnerable fields.
