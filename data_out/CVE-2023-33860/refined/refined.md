- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security QRadar EDR Software is vulnerable to link injection, observable login response discrepancy, and local storage of web pages readable by other users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Link injection: Allows an attacker to embed malicious links to external sites or different pages.
    - Observable login response discrepancy: Could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
    - Local storage of web pages: Pages could be stored locally and read by another user on the system, exposing information.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Malicious links could be used to redirect users to phishing sites or other malicious resources.
    - Sensitive information could be exposed due to login response discrepancies.
    - User data stored in local web pages could be accessed by unauthorized users.
- **Attack vectors**: Link injection via the application, observable login responses, and unauthorized access to locally stored web pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject links into the application, observe login responses, and access local storage on the system.
