Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8241:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `align` attribute within the 'wp:separator' Gutenberg block in the Nova Blocks plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `align` attribute and escape output when rendering the separator block. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** By injecting malicious scripts via the `align` attribute, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who access pages containing the manipulated separator block.
*   **Potential for Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could potentially perform various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or altering page content, depending on the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Gutenberg Block:** The vulnerability resides in the handling of the `align` attribute within the 'wp:separator' Gutenberg block provided by the plugin.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to craft malicious code within the `align` attribute of the block.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" level access (or higher) to a WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin. This is because contributors have the ability to create and modify content where blocks can be manipulated.
*   **Block Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the separator block and its `align` attribute within the WordPress block editor.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Nova Blocks plugin versions up to and including 2.1.7.
*   The fix was implemented in version 2.1.8 by improving sanitization and escaping of the align attribute. Specifically the fix includes using `sanitize_html_class()` when rendering the class name and `esc_attr` when outputting the class attribute.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Francesco Carlucci.
*   The Wordfence Intelligence team assigned the CVSS score of 6.4 (Medium).
