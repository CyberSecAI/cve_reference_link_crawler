{
  "CVE-2024-24592": {
    "root_cause": "The fileserver component of the ClearML Server does not authenticate requests to its endpoints.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication",
      "Arbitrary file upload",
       "Arbitrary file modification",
        "Arbitrary file deletion",
       "Arbitrary file download"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can arbitrarily upload, delete, modify, or download files on the fileserver, even if the files belong to another user. The fileserver can be used to host any files, which could cause issues with space and storage, and may have legal ramifications if used to host malware or stolen data.  An attacker can add malicious content to a previously verified file with no evidence of a change visible to regular users.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to know the address of the ClearML server. The default fileserver is on port 8081 on the same IP address as the web server, which is reachable through a quick Shodan search. An attacker can then manipulate files on the fileserver.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the address of the ClearML server, which is available through Shodan search."
