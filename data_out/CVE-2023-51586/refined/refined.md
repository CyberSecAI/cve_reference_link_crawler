Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before its use in constructing SQL queries within the `selectEventConfig` method of the Voltronic Power ViewPower Pro application.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a SQL Injection vulnerability. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or validate input before using it in a SQL query, thus allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This means the attacker gains significant control over the affected system.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (remote), and no authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application; no prior authentication or special privileges are needed.

The advisory also notes that the vendor was unresponsive to multiple attempts to report the vulnerability and coordinate a fix, both by the ZDI and CISA.
