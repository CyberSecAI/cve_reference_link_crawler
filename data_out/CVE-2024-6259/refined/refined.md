- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An improper discarding routine in `bt_hci_le_adv_ext_report` within `/subsys/bluetooth/host/scan.c` leads to a heap overflow. Specifically, the `net_buf_pull` function is used without checking if sufficient data remains in the buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Heap overflow due to missing length check before pulling data from a buffer.
    - Improper handling of buffer length.
    - Underwrap of the buffer length.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation could lead to instability (i.e., crash) or denial of service attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Adjacent network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to be in an adjacent network to exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted Bluetooth advertising report. No specific user interaction is required. The attacker does not require any privileges.
