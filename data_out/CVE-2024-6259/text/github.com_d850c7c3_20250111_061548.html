# BT: HCI: adv\_ext\_report Improper discarding in adv\_ext\_report

High

[ceolin](/ceolin)
published
GHSA-p5j7-v26w-wmcp
Sep 13, 2024

## Package

zephyr
(zephyr)

## Affected versions

<=3.6

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

An improper discarding routine causes a heap overflow in `bt_hci_le_adv_ext_report` in `/subsys/bluetooth/host/scan.c`.

### Details

After pulling `bt_hci_evt_le_ext_advertising_info` from the buffer, it sometimes proceeds to the `cont` routine based on event types and states.

```
		...

		if (buf->len < sizeof(*evt)) {
			LOG_ERR("Unexpected end of buffer");
			break;
		}
		...

		if (evt_type & BT_HCI_LE_ADV_EVT_TYPE_LEGACY) {
			/* Legacy advertising reports are complete.
			 * Create event immediately.
			 */
			create_ext_adv_info(evt, &scan_info);
			le_adv_recv(&evt->addr, &scan_info, &buf->b, evt->length);
			goto cont;
		}

		...

cont:
		net_buf_pull(buf, evt->length);

```

In `cont` routine, there is no length check of remaining buffer before pulling data, causing under wrap of the buffer length. This bypasses the next check of the remaining buffer size, directly leading to a heap overflow.

### PoC

Set the number of reports to a value other than `0` to enter the while loop.

The remaining buffer after pulling 1 byte should be larger than `sizeof(*evt)` which is 24 bytes.

Set the `evt_type` of first `bt_hci_evt_le_ext_advertising_info` to `BT_HCI_LE_ADV_EVT_TYPE_LEGACY`, which is `BIT(4)`.

`evt->length` can vary depending on input length.

### Impact

Result of exploitation could lead to instability (i.e., crash) or denial of service attacks.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
