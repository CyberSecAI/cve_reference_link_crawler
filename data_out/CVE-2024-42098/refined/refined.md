Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `ecdh_set_secret` function in `crypto/ecdh.c` handles the private key. The `private_key` is overwritten either with a provided key or a newly generated key. If the provided or generated key is shorter than the previously used key, parts of the old key would remain in memory, leading to information leakage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Incomplete Overwrite:** The core issue is that the function doesn't fully overwrite the `private_key` buffer when a new, shorter key is set.
-   **Information Leakage:** The residual data from the previous private key remains in memory, which can be read by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Private Key Exposure:** An attacker could potentially recover portions of the previous private key.
-   **Compromise of ECDH:** Exposure of the private key compromises the security of ECDH key exchanges.
-   **Potential for Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** This can lead to the possibility of an attacker decrypting communications or impersonating the legitimate party.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   An attacker needs to control the parameters of the ECDH key exchange, specifically the size of the key, to force the function to use a shorter key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker needs the ability to influence the key exchange process, either by providing a shorter key or observing multiple exchanges with different key sizes.
-   The attacker needs read access to the memory where the private key is stored.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The fix is to zeroize the `private_key` array before writing new key material into it. This eliminates any residual data.
- The patch also changes the behavior such that the private\_key is always zeroized even if ecc\_gen\_privkey fails, making it consistent with the case when `params.key` is set, and ecc\_is\_key\_valid fails.
