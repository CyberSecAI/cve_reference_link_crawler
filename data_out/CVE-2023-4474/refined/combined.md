## Summary

An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the web management interface of some Zyxel NAS versions. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform unauthorized actions on an affected device remotely.

Furthermore, multiple post-auth blind OS command injection vulnerabilities exist when some Zyxel NAS versions improperly handle user-provided input. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary OS commands on an affected device.

By leveraging the blind OS command injection vulnerabilities chained together with the authentication bypass vulnerability, an unauthenticated, remote attacker could perform unauthorized actions in the context of the `root` user.

From time to time, security bugs like these draw attention to the fact that it is essential to address vulnerabilities that require authentication to exploit. An authentication bypass vulnerability will eventually allow attackers to exploit the issues that previously required valid user credentials.

## Details

## CVE-2023-4473 - Authentication bypass vulnerability

The specific flaw exists within the access check mechanism implemented in the `auth_zyxel_module` module of the Apache web server. Based on our earlier research, we have found that attackers can use specific path segments to bypass the access check that would otherwise redirect unauthorized users to the login page. Attackers could leverage this vulnerability to access otherwise disallowed URLs.

The web management interface appears to be affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. The web server skips the access check mechanism for URLs containing specific path segments. For example, under normal circumstances, only authenticated users can access path `/nas326/cmd,/ck6fup6/system_main/whoami`, and the web server redirects unauthenticated users to the login page, as *Figure 1.* shows.

[![Figure 1. The web server redirects an unauthenticated request to the login page](/uploads/Figure01_Po_C_1_12968cb332.png)

Figure 1. The web server redirects an unauthenticated request to the login page](/uploads/Figure01_Po_C_1_12968cb332.png)

However, the webserver grants access to the same `/nas326/cmd,/ck6fup6/system_main/whoami` path after appending the `/favicon.ico` path segment to the URL, as *Figure 2.* shows.

[![Figure 2. The web server did not redirect an unauthenticated request to the login page](/uploads/Figure02_Po_C_2_24e3a6bc76.png)

Figure 2. The web server did not redirect an unauthenticated request to the login page](/uploads/Figure02_Po_C_2_24e3a6bc76.png)

Although an additional authentication layer protects specific paths on the web application level, the access check mechanism implemented in the web server module is the only protection for many paths. Hence, leveraging this vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated attacker to exploit vulnerabilities that the access control mechanism of the web server would otherwise mitigate.

For example, chaining this authentication bypass vulnerability with the package initialization mechanism's post-auth OS command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. An attacker can access the vulnerable feature available at the `/nas326/cmd,/ck6fup6/portal_main/pkg_init_cmd` path by simply appending the `/favicon.ico` path segment to the URL, as *Figure 3.* shows.

[![Figure 3. Chaining an authentication bypass with an OS command injection vulnerability](/uploads/Figure03_pkg_init_cmd_cb8f959c3c.png)

Figure 3. Chaining an authentication bypass with an OS command injection vulnerability](/uploads/Figure03_pkg_init_cmd_cb8f959c3c.png)

Furthermore, chaining this authentication bypass vulnerability with an information disclosure vulnerability in the system information feature allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack existing user sessions. The attacker can obtain a currently logged-in user's authorization token transmitted in the `authtok` cookie from the application's response to a request sent to `/system_main/show_sysinfo`, as *Figure 4.* shows.

[![Figure 4. Disclosed authorization token of the currently logged-on user](/uploads/Figure04_show_sysinfo_7d848b1e12.png)

Figure 4. Disclosed authorization token of the currently logged-on user](/uploads/Figure04_show_sysinfo_7d848b1e12.png)

The application uses the `auth_zyxel_module` module to enforce authentication on the web server level by redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page. However, the web server may skip this access check mechanism when serving specific routes. The `AuthZyxelSkipPattern` directive within the web server configuration file `/etc/service_conf/httpd.conf` specifies the exceptions to this mechanism, as shown in *Figure 5.*

[![Figure 5. Path segments allowed to skip access check](/uploads/Figure05_Auth_Zyxel_Skip_Pattern_fc639bb8ae.png)

Figure 5. Path segments allowed to skip access check](/uploads/Figure05_Auth_Zyxel_Skip_Pattern_fc639bb8ae.png)

Further analysis revealed that the vulnerability may lie in the `FUN_0001116c()` function within the `mod_auth_zyxel.so` file. The following is a simplified excerpt of the decompiled source code of the affected function:

```
bool FUN_0001116c(char *path, char *pattern) {
    pathLen = strlen(path);
    patternLen = strlen(pattern);
    haystack = malloc(pathLen + 1);
    needle = malloc(patternLen + 1);
    for ( i = 0; i < pathLen; ++i )
      haystack[i] = tolower(path[i]);
    haystack[i] = 0;
    for ( j = 0; j < patternLen; ++j )
      needle[j] = tolower(pattern[j]);
    needle[j] = 0;
    result = strstr(haystack, needle) != 0;
    free(haystack);
    free(needle);
    return result;
}

```

`FUN_0001116c()` calls the `strstr()` function to search for the given pattern within the request path. However, the function ignores the pattern's position within the path. Therefore, URLs containing the pattern within additional path segments appended to the original path will also satisfy this check. Since only the preceding path segments are relevant when processing a request, this path manipulation has no negative impact on the application.

Be aware that attackers may use any patterns specified in the web server configuration file to avoid redirection to the login page. An unauthenticated user can confirm the vulnerability via the following URLs:

```
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/system_main/whoami/favicon.ico
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/portal_main/pkg_init_cmd/register_main/setCookie?pkgname=myZyXELcloud-Agent&cmd=%3bid&content=1

```
## CVE-2023-4474 - Multiple blind OS command injection vulnerabilities

### OS command injection vulnerabilities in `zylog_main`

The specific flaws exist in the command execution mechanism implemented in various functions within the `zylog_main.py` file. Attackers can use specially crafted values provided in multiple query parameters in an HTTP request processed by the `show_logging_entries()`, `configure_mail_syslog()`, or `test_mail()` functions to execute arbitrary OS commands. Attackers could leverage these vulnerabilities to execute commands in the context of the WSGI server process, running as `root`.

The web management interface appears to be vulnerable to OS command injection because an attacker can use the semicolon "`;`" character to append arbitrary commands to the intended command string executed by the application. The application does not seem to return the command output in its response.

We submitted the payload `;sleep 5` in the `type` parameter at the path `/cmd,/ck6fup6/zylog_main/show_logging_entries`. The application took longer to respond to the PoC request than the original one, indicating that the injected `sleep` command caused a time delay, as *Figure 6.* shows.

[![Figure 6. OS command injection vulnerability in the type parameter](/uploads/Figure06_show_logging_entries_908b38936e.png)

Figure 6. OS command injection vulnerability in the type parameter](/uploads/Figure06_show_logging_entries_908b38936e.png)

We submitted the payload `;sleep 5` in the `scheduleMinute` parameter at the path `/cmd,/ck6fup6/zylog_main/configure_mail_syslog`. The application took longer to respond to the PoC request than the original one, indicating that the injected `sleep` command caused a time delay, as Figure 7. shows. Be aware that the response time is twice the delay, indicating that the application executed the injected command two times. Furthermore, the `mailTo`, `mailFrom`, `mailServer`, `mailFormat`, `accountSMTP`, `passwdSMTP`, `scheduleDay`, and `scheduleHour` parameters also appear to be affected by this issue.

[![Figure 7. OS command injection vulnerability in the scheduleMinute parameter](/uploads/Figure07_configure_mail_syslog_40a3944e80.png)

Figure 7. OS command injection vulnerability in the scheduleMinute parameter](/uploads/Figure07_configure_mail_syslog_40a3944e80.png)

We submitted the payload `;sleep 5` in the `to` parameter at the path `/cmd,/ck6fup6/zylog_main/test_mail`. The application took longer to respond to the PoC request than the original one, indicating that the injected `sleep` command caused a time delay, as *Figure 8.* shows. Be aware that the `server`, `from`, `user` and `passwd` parameters are also affected.

[![Figure 8. OS command injection vulnerability in the to parameter](/uploads/Figure08_test_mail_01cb088914.png)

Figure 8. OS command injection vulnerability in the to parameter](/uploads/Figure08_test_mail_01cb088914.png)

Further analysis revealed that the vulnerabilities lie in the `configure_mail_syslog()` function within the `zylog_main.py` file and in the `show_log()`, `configure_mail()`, `configure_no_syslog()`, `configure_syslog()` and `test_mail()` functions within the `zylog_show_config.py` file.

The application usually constructs command strings to call the `zylog_dump`, `zylog_config`, `zylog_no_logging`, and `zylog_send_testmail` binaries in the `/usr/sbin` directory via the `os.popen()` function. One exception is the `configure_mail_syslog()` function, which calls the `os.system()` function with a command string containing unsanitized user input from multiple query parameters. The following is the relevant excerpt of the affected functionâs decompiled source code:

```
def configure_mail_syslog(cherrypy, arguments):
...SNIP...
    write_pyconf()
    mail_schedule = pyconf.get_conf_value(MAINTENANCE_LOG_MAIL, 'schedule')
    if mail_schedule != '':
        if mail_schedule == 'weekly':
            mail_day = pyconf.get_conf_value(MAINTENANCE_LOG_MAIL, 'day')
            mail_hour = pyconf.get_conf_value(MAINTENANCE_LOG_MAIL, 'hour')
            mail_minute = pyconf.get_conf_value(MAINTENANCE_LOG_MAIL, 'miniute')
            cmd = '/usr/sbin/zylog_config mail 1 schedule weekly day %s hour %s minute %s' % (mail_day, mail_hour, mail_minute)
            os.system(cmd)
        if mail_schedule == 'daily':
            mail_hour = pyconf.get_conf_value(MAINTENANCE_LOG_MAIL, 'hour')
            mail_minute = pyconf.get_conf_value(MAINTENANCE_LOG_MAIL, 'miniute')
            cmd = '/usr/sbin/zylog_config mail 1 schedule daily hour %s minute %s' % (mail_hour, mail_minute)
            os.system(cmd)
...SNIP...

```

The function calls `write_pyconf()` to store the new settings, including the injected commands, in the application's configuration file at `/etc/zyxel/py_conf`, as *Figure 9.* shows. Therefore, this vulnerability would allow attackers to quickly deploy a persistent backdoor on the affected system.

[![Figure 9. Injected commands stored in the configuration file](/uploads/Figure09_py_conf_f5b963fdf0.png)

Figure 9. Injected commands stored in the configuration file](/uploads/Figure09_py_conf_f5b963fdf0.png)

In other instances of the vulnerability, the application uses the `os.popen()` function to run a specific `zylog_*` binary and return the executed commandâs output. The following are the relevant excerpts of the affected functions within the `zylog_show_config.py` file.

```
def show_log(type):
    if type == 'all':
...SNIP...
    else:
        strcmd = '/usr/sbin/zylog_dump entries category %s' % type
    retvalue = os.popen(strcmd)
...SNIP...

def configure_mail(type, data):
   if type == 'enable' and data == 'yes':
...SNIP...
   else:
       strcmd = '/usr/sbin/zylog_config mail 1 %s %s' % (type, data)
       retvalue = os.popen(strcmd)

def configure_no_syslog(type, data):
   if type == 'enable' and data == '':

...SNIP...
   else:
       strcmd = '/usr/sbin/zylog_no_logging syslog 1 %s %s' % (type, data)
       retvalue = os.popen(strcmd)

def configure_syslog(type, data):
   if type == 'enable' and data == 'yes':
...SNIP...
   else:
       strcmd = '/usr/sbin/zylog_config syslog 1 %s %s' % (type, data)
       retvalue = os.popen(strcmd)

def test_mail(server, mail_from, to, user, passwd):
    if passwd != '':
        strcmd = '/usr/sbin/zylog_send_testmail mail test server %s from %s to %s user %s passwd %s' % (server, mail_from, to, user, passwd)
    elif user != '':
        strcmd = '/usr/sbin/zylog_send_testmail mail test server %s from %s to %s user %s' % (server, mail_from, to, user)
    else:
        strcmd = '/usr/sbin/zylog_send_testmail mail test server %s from %s to %s' % (server, mail_from, to)
    retvalue = os.popen(strcmd)
...SNIP...

```

As the above source code shows, the application constructs a command string from the values of the user-supplied parameters. The `os.popen()` function passes the constructed command string to the shell, meaning that attackers can use whitespace and shell metacharacters to create shell commands. For example, the semicolon "`;`" metacharacter used in the PoC payloads allows the execution of sequential commands, one after the other. Executing shell commands that incorporate unsanitized input from an untrusted source makes the application vulnerable to command injection, resulting in arbitrary command execution.

The vulnerabilities can be confirmed with an unauthenticated user via the following URLs by leveraging the authentication bypass vulnerability:

```
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/zylog_main/show_logging_entries/favicon.ico?type=%3bsleep%205
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/zylog_main/configure_mail_syslog/favicon.ico?schedulePeriod=daily&scheduleHour=1&scheduleMinute=%3bsleep%205
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/zylog_main/test_mail/favicon.ico?server=a&from=b&to=c%3bsleep%205

```
### OS command injection vulnerabilities in `zypkg_main`

The specific flaws exist within the implementation of the package management mechanism in the `zypkg_main.py` component of the web management interface. Attackers can use a specially crafted value in the `pkgname` query parameter attached to a URL with the path `/cmd,/ck6fup6/zypkg_main/pkg_disable` to execute arbitrary OS commands. Attackers could leverage this vulnerability to execute commands in the context of the WSGI server process, running as `root`.

The web management interface appears to be vulnerable to OS command injection because an attacker can use the semicolon "`;`" character to append arbitrary commands to the intended command string executed by the application. The application does not seem to return the command output in its response.

We submitted the payload `;sleep 5` in the `pkgname` parameter at the path `/cmd,/tjp6jp6y4/zypkg_main/pkg_disable`. The application took longer to respond to the PoC request than the original request, indicating that the injected `sleep` command caused a time delay, as *Figure 10.* shows. Be aware that other actions within the `zypkg_main` controller (e.g. `pkg_install`) are also affected by this issue.

[![Figure 10. OS command injection vulnerability in the pkgname parameter](/uploads/Figure10_pkg_disable_ce3ab5458f.png)

Figure 10. OS command injection vulnerability in the pkgname parameter](/uploads/Figure10_pkg_disable_ce3ab5458f.png)

Further analysis revealed that the vulnerability lies in the `zymanager_cmd_interface()` function within the `zypkg_main_model.py` and the `StoExecRoot()` function within the `storage_func.py` files. The application constructs a command string to perform the chosen operation of the package specified in the `pkgname` parameter, in some cases with additional arguments. The command string `/usr/local/apache/web_framework/bin/executer_su /usr/bin/ipkg-cl -f /etc/zyxel/pkg_conf/zypkg_conf/zy-pkg.conf -t /i-data/.system/zy-pkgs/tmp disable &lt;PACKAGE>` is an example of the disable operation where the user provides the value for `&lt;PACKAGE>`. The following is the decompiled source code of the affected functions:

```
def pkgdisable(pkgname):
    cmd_result = zymanager_cmd_interface(ZYPKG_DISABLE, pkgname)
    return cmd_result

def zymanager_cmd_interface(CmdID, pkgname=None):
    if pkgname == None:
        cmd = zypkgcmdname[CmdID]
        cmd_result = storage_func.StoExecRoot(cmd)
    else:
        cmd = zypkgcmdname[CmdID] + ' ' + pkgname
        cmd_result = storage_func.StoExecRoot(cmd)
    return cmd_result

```

The `StoExecRoot()` function calls the `subproccess.Popen()` function to execute the constructed command string passed in the `cmd` parameter. Since the shell parameter is set to `True`, the specified command will be executed through the shell, meaning that attackers can use whitespace and shell metacharacters to create shell commands. For example, the semicolon "`;`" metacharacter used in the PoC payload allows the execution of sequential commands, one after the other. The following is the decompiled source code of the affected function:

```
def StoExecRoot(cmd, withRetCode=False):
    exec_path = '/usr/local/apache/web_framework/bin/executer_su '
    arg_set = exec_path + cmd
    pipe = Popen(arg_set, shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=None)
    if withRetCode:
        return (pipe.communicate()[0].strip(), pipe.returncode)
    else:
        return pipe.communicate()[0].strip()

```

Executing shell commands that incorporate unsanitized input from an untrusted source makes the application vulnerable to command injection, resulting in arbitrary command execution. For this reason, the use of `shell=True` is strongly discouraged in cases where the application constructs a command string from external input.

The vulnerabilities can be confirmed with an unauthenticated user via the following URLs by leveraging the authentication bypass vulnerability:

```
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/zypkg_main/pkg_disable/favicon.ico?pkgname=%26sleep%205
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/zypkg_main/pkg_install/favicon.ico?pkgname=a&active=b&volumeID=c%26id%3E/tmp/bugproved

```

Be aware that some operations (e.g. package installation) are executed in another thread, hence the vulnerability cannot be confirmed via time delays.

### OS command injection vulnerabilities in `time_machine_main`

The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the service configuration mechanism in the `time_machine_main.py` component of the web management interface. Attackers can use a specially crafted value provided in the `target_share` query parameter attached to a URL with the path `/cmd,/ck6fup6/time_machine_main/setTimeMachineStatus` to execute arbitrary OS commands.

The web management interface appears to be vulnerable to OS command injection because attackers can use the semicolon "`;`" character to append arbitrary commands to the original command intended to generate `avahi` service configuration files. The application does not seem to return the command output in its response.

We submitted the payload `;sleep 5` in the `share_name` parameter at the path `/cmd,/ck6fup6/time_machine_main/setTimeMachineStatus`. The application took longer to respond to the PoC request than the original one, indicating that the injected sleep command caused a time delay, as *Figure 11.* shows.

[![Figure 11. OS command injection vulnerability in the target_share parameter](/uploads/Figure11_target_share_377dd4b27c.png)

Figure 11. OS command injection vulnerability in the target\_share parameter](/uploads/Figure11_target_share_377dd4b27c.png)

Further analysis revealed that the vulnerability lies in the `setTimeMachineStatus()` and the `set_time_machine_config()` functions within the `time_machine_main.py` and `time_machine_main_model.py` files. The application constructs a command string to generate an `avahi` service configuration file. The following is the decompiled source code of the affected function:

```
def setTimeMachineStatus(cherrypy, arguments):
    auth_status = tools_cherrypy.authentication(arguments)
    if auth_status != tools_cherrypy.AUTH_PASS:
        return tools_cherrypy.gui_errmsg(auth_status)
    if arguments.has_key('target_share') and arguments.has_key('active'):
        time_machine_config = {}
        time_machine_config['active'] = arguments['active']
        time_machine_config['target_share'] = arguments['target_share']
        rvalue = time_machine_model.set_time_machine_config(time_machine_config)
        if rvalue != 'Success':
            return tools_cherrypy.GUI_SUCCESS.gui_errmsg(rvalue)
    else:
        return tools_cherrypy.GUI_SUCCESS.gui_errmsg('Argument error!')
    write_pyconf()
    return tools_cherrypy.GUI_SUCCESS

```

The command string constructed from the user-supplied `target_share` parameter will be executed in a subshell via the `os.system()` function, meaning that attackers can use whitespace and shell metacharacters to create shell commands. For example, the semicolon "`;`" metacharacter used in the PoC payload allows the execution of sequential commands, one after the other. The following is the decompiled source code of the affected function:

```
def set_time_machine_config(time_machine_config):
    pyconf.modify_conf_value(TIME_MACHINE_PYCONF_PATH, 'active', time_machine_config['active'])
    pyconf.modify_conf_value(TIME_MACHINE_PYCONF_PATH, 'target_share', time_machine_config['target_share'])
    if time_machine_config['active'] == 'true':
        cmd = '/usr/sbin/gen_avahi_config.sh tm %s' % time_machine_config['target_share']
        os.system(cmd)
    else:
        cmd = 'rm -f /etc/avahi/services/tm.service'
        os.system(cmd)
    return 'Success'

```

Executing shell commands that incorporate unsanitized input from an untrusted source makes the application vulnerable to command injection, resulting in arbitrary command execution. For this reason, the use of `os.system()` is strongly discouraged in cases where the command string is constructed from external input.

The vulnerability can be confirmed with an authenticated user via the following URL:

```
http[:]//NAS326/cmd,/ck6fup6/time_machine_main/setTimeMachineStatus?whoami=admin&active=true&target_share=%3bsleep%205

```
