Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-46759.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an integer underflow in the `adc128d818` hardware monitoring driver. Specifically, when writing limit attributes, the `DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST()` operation, performed after `kstrtol()` (string to long conversion), can result in an underflow if a large negative number (e.g., -9223372036854775808) is provided as input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer underflow: The primary vulnerability is an integer underflow occurring during the calculation of register values. This happens due to the order of operations, where the division (`DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST()`) is performed after clamping the value, leading to unexpected results if a large negative value is input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The integer underflow could lead to incorrect values being written to the hardware registers, causing unexpected behavior or misreporting of sensor data. The impact would be limited to hardware monitoring functionality, and it does not appear to lead to privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user space interaction with the sysfs interface for the hardware monitoring driver. By providing a large negative number as input through the sysfs attribute, an attacker can trigger the integer underflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to write to the relevant sysfs attributes of the `adc128d818` hardware monitoring driver. This requires some level of local access with permissions to interact with the specific hwmon device.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves reordering the operations, performing the `clamp_val()` operation before the `DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST()`. This prevents the underflow by limiting the input range before the division, and making sure that the division will always be done with the correct range for the result.
- The fix is applied in the `adc128_in_store` and `adc128_temp_store` functions of the `drivers/hwmon/adc128d818.c` file.
