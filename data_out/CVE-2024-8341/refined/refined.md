Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of file type restrictions in the `add_user.php` script of the Petshop Management System. The application allows users to upload any file type, leading to arbitrary file upload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary weakness is the absence of validation or restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded. This allows an attacker to upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of the web server
    *   Data theft or manipulation
    *   Denial of service
    *   Further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/Petshop_Management_System/controllers/add_user.php` endpoint.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The request uses `multipart/form-data` to submit a form containing a file.
*   **Malicious File Upload:** The attacker includes a malicious file (e.g., a PHP file with `<?php phpinfo();?>` content) as the "avatar" file in the form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable Petshop Management System.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests, particularly how to form POST requests with multipart form data.
*   **Targeted Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `(/Petshop_Management_System/controllers/add_user.php)`

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit payload is an HTTP POST request, as follows:
```
POST /Petshop_Management_System/controllers/add_user.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.2.110
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:129.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/129.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Referer: http://192.168.2.110/Petshop_Management_System/
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundarysOcLQ1YbU3iam8cM
Content-Length: 175

------WebKitFormBoundarysOcLQ1YbU3iam8cM
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar";filename="test2.php"

<?php phpinfo();?>
------WebKitFormBoundarysOcLQ1YbU3iam8cM--
```

The key parts are:

*   `Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundarysOcLQ1YbU3iam8cM` This indicates the request is sending form data with files
*   `name="avatar";filename="test2.php"`: This specifies the name of the file parameter, and the filename of the uploaded file.
*   `<?php phpinfo();?>`: This is the malicious PHP content.
