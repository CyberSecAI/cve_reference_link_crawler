Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0367

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Unlimited Elements For Elementor WordPress plugin

**Affected Versions:**  <= 1.5.96

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes, specifically within the link field of installed widgets (e.g., 'Button Link').

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before storing it in the database.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape the stored input before outputting it to a web page, allowing the injected script to execute in a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user accesses an injected page, the malicious script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Malware distribution
*   Defacement of the website
*   Data theft
*   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker injects the malicious script into the link field of a widget using the plugin's interface.
*   The injected script is stored in the database.
*   When a user views a page containing the affected widget, the stored script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This is necessary to have the ability to edit or create content and add widgets.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is patched in version 1.5.97.
