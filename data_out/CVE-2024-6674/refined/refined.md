**Content Analysis:**

The provided content is a diff of a commit to the `lollms-webui` repository on GitHub. The commit `c1bb1ad19752aa7541675b398495eaf98fd589f1` contains changes primarily related to UI updates, refactoring API calls, and updating dependencies.

**Specific changes of interest**
*   The commit modifies several Vue components (`DiscussionsView.vue`, `SettingsView.vue`), introducing changes in how API calls are made. Instead of using `axios.get` for certain actions, it switches to `axios.post` while also including a `client_id` parameter, often from the store state, to identify the client making the request.

    - Examples include changes to `/set_active_binding_settings`, `/select_database`, `/get_config`,  `/install_comfyui`, `/upgrade_comfyui`, `/start_comfyui`, `/show_comfyui`, `/install_motion_ctrl`, `/install_vllm`, `/start_vllm`, `/start_ollama`, `/install_petals`, `/install_ollama`, and `/start_xtts` endpoints.
    -   In `SettingsView.vue`, the `axios.personalitiesFiltered` call on line 4457 is likely a typo and should have been `axios.post`.
*   The file `web/dist/index.html` is modified to include the updated Javascript and CSS files.
*   The submodule `lollms_core` is updated.
