# Statement and Solution for KubeSphere IDOR Security Vulnerability CVE-2024-46528

[![twitter icon](/images/share/Twitter.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.kubesphere.io%2fnews%2fkubesphere-cve-2024-46528%2f&text=Statement%20and%20Solution%20for%20KubeSphere%20IDOR%20Security%20Vulnerability%20CVE-2024-46528)[![reddit icon](/images/share/Reddit.svg)](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.kubesphere.io%2fnews%2fkubesphere-cve-2024-46528%2f&title=Statement%20and%20Solution%20for%20KubeSphere%20IDOR%20Security%20Vulnerability%20CVE-2024-46528)[![facebook icon](/images/share/Facebook.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.kubesphere.io%2fnews%2fkubesphere-cve-2024-46528%2f)[![linkedin icon](/images/share/Linkedin.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.kubesphere.io%2fnews%2fkubesphere-cve-2024-46528%2f)[![hackernews icon](/images/share/HackerNews.svg)](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.kubesphere.io%2fnews%2fkubesphere-cve-2024-46528%2f&t=Statement%20and%20Solution%20for%20KubeSphere%20IDOR%20Security%20Vulnerability%20CVE-2024-46528)

Recently, security technicians from a third-party platform discovered a vulnerability of Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in KubeSphere 3.4.1 and 4.1.1. This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker with low privileges to access sensitive resources without proper authorization checks. We promptly contacted the other party and helped them solve this problem. For detailed information about the CVE vulnerability and the problem-solving process, please refer to the following links:

* [CVE-2024-46528](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46528)
* [IDOR Vulnerability in KubeSphere](https://okankurtulus.com.tr/2024/09/09/idor-vulnerability-in-kubesphere/)

## Affected Versions

* KubeSphere 4.x: < 4.1.3
* KubeSphere 3.x: >= 3.0.0, <= 3.4.1
* KubeSphere Enterprise 4.x: < 4.1.3
* KubeSphere Enterprise 3.x: >= 3.0.0, <= 3.5.0

## Workaround

Remove the non-essential resource authorization of the `authenticated` platform role:

```
kubectl patch globalrole.iam.kubesphere.io authenticated --type merge -p '{"rules": [{"apiGroups":["monitoring.kubesphere.io","metering.kubesphere.io","monitoring.coreos.com"],"resources":["cluster"],"verbs":["list"]},{"apiGroups":["resources.kubesphere.io"],"resources":["clusters"],"verbs":["get","list"]}]}'

```

This change strengthens the permission constraints on ordinary users. When an ordinary project member opens a page and wants to call these APIs that require privileges, a "forbidden" pop-up box will appear.

## Remediation Plan

The risk level of this vulnerability is not high. You can solve this problem through the above workaround. We will fix this issue in the next version KubeSphere 4.1.3, and the expected release time is January 2025.

## Security Commitment

KubeSphere is continuously committed to providing enterprise customers with a secure and reliable cloud-native full-stack solution. We value the trust of users in our platform and strive to ensure that our system meets the highest security and performance standards.

At the same time, the KubeSphere community expresses great gratitude to [Okan KurtuluÅ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/okankurtuluss/) for the timely discovery of this problem and the active communication with us.

# IDOR Vulnerability in KubeSphere / CVE-2024-46528

Yayınlanan [9 September 202421 October 2024](https://okankurtulus.com.tr/2024/09/09/idor-vulnerability-in-kubesphere/) by [Okan Kurtuluş](https://okankurtulus.com.tr/author/okankurtulus/)

Hi guys,

I am writing to report a potential Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability that I have discovered in KubeSphere. Below are the details of the vulnerability:

There is a potential Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability in KubeSphere which allows unauthorized users to access sensitive resources by manipulating object references. This issue can lead to unauthorized data exposure or modification without proper authorization checks.

**CVE Number:**
CVE-2024-46528

**Affected Versions:**
Both the open-source version of KubeSphere (kubesphere.io) and the Enterprise version (kubesphere.co) are affected by this vulnerability.

KubeSphere 4.x: < 4.1.3

KubeSphere 3.x: >= 3.0.0, <= 3.4.1

KubeSphere Enterprise 4.x: < 4.1.3

KubeSphere Enterprise 3.x: >= 3.0.0, <= 3.5.0

**Vulnerability Verification Process:**
**1-)** When I checked the roles in the system, I noticed a role named “platform-regular.” The description for this role stated: “Cannot access any resources before joining a workspace.” This means that users with this role shouldn’t be able to access any resources unless they are part of a workspace.

**2-)** I created a user named “**okankurtulus**” and assigned the “platform-regular” role to this user. This user does not have access to any workspaces.

![](https://okankurtulus.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/poc-3-1024x478.png)

**3-)** However, despite not having access to any workspace, this user can access cluster resources, cluster nodes, registered users in the system, and other similar areas without having the necessary permissions.

I have reported the vulnerability to the vendor. They responded quickly and provided a solution for the finding. If you upgrade to the latest version, you will not be affected by the vulnerability.

To mitigate the impact of this security vulnerability, you can implement the precautions recommended by the vendor.

| CVSS Rating: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  Recently, security researchers from a third-party platform discovered an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the open-source versions of KubeSphere 3.4.1 and 4.1.1. This vulnerability allows low-privileged authenticated attackers to access sensitive resources without proper authorization checks. We promptly contacted the team and assisted them in resolving the issue. Detailed information about the CVE vulnerability and the resolution process can be found in the following links:  [CVE-2024-46528](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46528) [IDOR Vulnerability in KubeSphere](https://okankurtulus.com.tr/2024/09/09/idor-vulnerability-in-kubesphere/) Am I vulnerable? The vulnerability allows low-privileged authenticated attackers to access sensitive resources without proper authorization checks, but this data cannot be directly exploited to cause significant impact. Affected Versions KubeSphere 4.x affected versions: < 4.1.3 KubeSphere 3.x affected versions: >= 3.0.0, <= 3.4.1 KubeSphere Enterprise 4.x affected versions: < 4.1.3 KubeSphere Enterprise 3.x affected versions: >= 3.0.0, <= 3.5.0 How do I mitigate this vulnerability? Remove unnecessary resource permissions from the authenticated platform role.  ``` kubectl patch globalrole.iam.kubesphere.io authenticated --type merge -p '{"rules": [{"apiGroups":["monitoring.kubesphere.io","metering.kubesphere.io","monitoring.coreos.com"],"resources":["cluster"],"verbs":["list"]},{"apiGroups":["resources.kubesphere.io"],"resources":["clusters"],"verbs":["get","list"]}]}' ``` Acknowledgements This vulnerability was reported by [Okan Kurtuluş](https://www.linkedin.com/in/okankurtuluss/).  /area security /kind bug |
