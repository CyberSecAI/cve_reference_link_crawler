| func init() { service.RegisterAuth(New())  ``` auth := jwt.New(&jwt.GfJWTMiddleware{ 	Realm:           "test zone", 	Key:             []byte("secret key"), 	Timeout:         time.Minute * 5, 	MaxRefresh:      time.Minute * 5, 	IdentityKey:     "id", 	TokenLookup:     "header: Authorization, query: token, cookie: jwt", 	TokenHeadName:   "Bearer", 	TimeFunc:        time.Now, 	Authenticator:   Auth().Authenticator, 	Unauthorized:    Auth().Unauthorized, 	PayloadFunc:     Auth().PayloadFunc, 	IdentityHandler: Auth().IdentityHandler, }) authService = auth  ```  }  In file `internal/logic/auth/auth.` line 37, there is a hard coded Key (Key) value, namely the "secret Key". Hard-coded credentials (such as keys, passwords, API keys, etc.) are one of the common mistakes of security development. If an attacker has access to these hard-coded credentials, they may be able to exploit them Data to access a system or service. Hard-coded credentials often lead to security risks because they make it easier for attackers to obtain sensitive information and potentially use it to perform malicious activities. |
