# Submit #393981: demozx gf\_cms None Hard-coded Credentials[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | demozx gf\_cms None Hard-coded Credentials |
| --- | --- |
| Description | func init() { service.RegisterAuth(New()) auth := jwt.New(&jwt.GfJWTMiddleware{ Realm: "test zone", Key: []byte("secret key"), Timeout: time.Minute \* 5, MaxRefresh: time.Minute \* 5, IdentityKey: "id", TokenLookup: "header: Authorization, query: token, cookie: jwt", TokenHeadName: "Bearer", TimeFunc: time.Now, Authenticator: Auth().Authenticator, Unauthorized: Auth().Unauthorized, PayloadFunc: Auth().PayloadFunc, IdentityHandler: Auth().IdentityHandler, }) authService = auth } In file ` internal/logic/auth/auth. Go ` line 37, there is a hard coded Key (Key) value, namely the "secret Key". Hard-coded credentials (such as keys, passwords, API keys, etc.) are one of the common mistakes of security development. If an attacker has access to these hard-coded credentials, they may be able to exploit them Data to access a system or service. Hard-coded credentials often lead to security risks because they make it easier for attackers to obtain sensitive information and potentially use it to perform malicious activities. |

| func init() { service.RegisterAuth(New())  ``` auth := jwt.New(&jwt.GfJWTMiddleware{ 	Realm:           "test zone", 	Key:             []byte("secret key"), 	Timeout:         time.Minute * 5, 	MaxRefresh:      time.Minute * 5, 	IdentityKey:     "id", 	TokenLookup:     "header: Authorization, query: token, cookie: jwt", 	TokenHeadName:   "Bearer", 	TimeFunc:        time.Now, 	Authenticator:   Auth().Authenticator, 	Unauthorized:    Auth().Unauthorized, 	PayloadFunc:     Auth().PayloadFunc, 	IdentityHandler: Auth().IdentityHandler, }) authService = auth  ```  }  In file `internal/logic/auth/auth.` line 37, there is a hard coded Key (Key) value, namely the "secret Key". Hard-coded credentials (such as keys, passwords, API keys, etc.) are one of the common mistakes of security development. If an attacker has access to these hard-coded credentials, they may be able to exploit them Data to access a system or service. Hard-coded credentials often lead to security risks because they make it easier for attackers to obtain sensitive information and potentially use it to perform malicious activities. |

| func init() { service.RegisterAuth(New())  ``` auth := jwt.New(&jwt.GfJWTMiddleware{ 	Realm:           "test zone", 	Key:             []byte("secret key"), 	Timeout:         time.Minute * 5, 	MaxRefresh:      time.Minute * 5, 	IdentityKey:     "id", 	TokenLookup:     "header: Authorization, query: token, cookie: jwt", 	TokenHeadName:   "Bearer", 	TimeFunc:        time.Now, 	Authenticator:   Auth().Authenticator, 	Unauthorized:    Auth().Unauthorized, 	PayloadFunc:     Auth().PayloadFunc, 	IdentityHandler: Auth().IdentityHandler, }) authService = auth  ```  }  In file `internal/logic/auth/auth.` line 37, there is a hard coded Key (Key) value, namely the "secret Key". Hard-coded credentials (such as keys, passwords, API keys, etc.) are one of the common mistakes of security development. If an attacker has access to these hard-coded credentials, they may be able to exploit them Data to access a system or service. Hard-coded credentials often lead to security risks because they make it easier for attackers to obtain sensitive information and potentially use it to perform malicious activities. |
