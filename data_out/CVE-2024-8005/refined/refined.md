Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded secret key within the JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication logic of the `gf_cms` application. Specifically, the `auth.go` file initialized the JWT middleware with `Key: []byte("secret key")`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of a hardcoded secret key, which is a well-known and easily discoverable value ("secret key").
- **JWT Secret Exposure:** The hardcoded key acts as the signing key for JWTs. If an attacker obtains this key, they can forge valid JWTs, bypassing authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker with the hardcoded key can generate valid JWTs and gain unauthorized access to the application and its resources.
- **Data Access and Manipulation:** Once authenticated, an attacker can access sensitive data or perform malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Code Review/Discovery:** An attacker could discover the hardcoded key by examining the application's source code.
- **Reverse Engineering:** An attacker with access to compiled code may be able to extract the hardcoded key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Code Access:** The attacker needs some means to access the source code or compiled binary to discover the hardcoded key.
- **Knowledge of JWT:** The attacker would need to understand how JWTs are structured to craft a token using the compromised key.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for the vulnerability involved replacing the hardcoded key with a configurable `jwtKey` setting. If this configuration value is not set, the application's `projectName` will be used as the JWT key.
- The configuration parameter `server.jwtKey` was added to `config.yaml.example` to enable configuration of the JWT secret key
- The file `internal/logic/util/util.go` was modified to retrieve the `jwtKey` from config. If `jwtKey` is not configured, `projectName` is used as default.
- The `auth.go` file was modified to use `util.Util().JwtKey()` to retrieve the secret key instead of using hardcoded value.

The information from `vuldb.com` confirms the presence of the hardcoded secret key vulnerability in the `gf_cms` application, specifically in the `internal/logic/auth/auth.go` file. It highlights the security risk due to hardcoded credentials and their potential for malicious use. The Github issue #5 also confirms the issue and its resolution.
