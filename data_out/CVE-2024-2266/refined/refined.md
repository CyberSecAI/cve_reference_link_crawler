```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly reflects the content of the `emailcookie` and `passwordcookie` cookies within the `value` attribute of the email and password input fields on the login page without proper sanitization or encoding.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the login page. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including: \n   - Transferring private information like session cookies to the attacker\n   - Sending malicious requests to the website on behalf of the victim, potentially leading to unauthorized actions\n   - Phishing attacks that trick victims into entering their passwords\n   - Exploiting web browser vulnerabilities and potentially taking over the victim's machine (drive-by hacking)",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker exploits the vulnerability by setting malicious values in the `emailcookie` and `passwordcookie` cookies. When the user visits the login page, the server directly embeds these values into the HTML input fields, leading to the execution of the injected JavaScript.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to set cookies on the victim's browser either through a separate vulnerability or by tricking the user into doing it. The attacker does not require prior authentication on the target system."
