|  |  | Release type: minor |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Starting with this release, multipart uploads are disabled by default and Strawberry Django view is no longer implicitly exempted from Django's CSRF protection. |
|  |  | Both changes relieve users from implicit security implications inherited from the GraphQL multipart request specification which was enabled in Strawberry by default. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | These are breaking changes if you are using multipart uploads OR the Strawberry Django view. |
|  |  | Migrations guides including further information are available on the Strawberry website. |

|  |  | # v0.240.0 Breaking Changes |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Release v0.240.0 comes with two breaking changes regarding multipart file |
|  |  | uploads and Django CSRF protection. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Multipart uploads disabled by default |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Previously, support for uploads via the |
|  |  | [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) |
|  |  | was enabled by default. This implicitly required Strawberry users to consider |
|  |  | the |
|  |  | [security implications outlined in the GraphQL Multipart Request Specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec/blob/master/readme.md#security). |
|  |  | Given that most Strawberry users were likely not aware of this, we're making |
|  |  | multipart file upload support stictly opt-in via a new |
|  |  | `multipart\_uploads\_enabled` view settings. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To enable multipart upload support for your Strawberry view integration, please |
|  |  | follow the updated integration guides and enable appropriate security |
|  |  | measurements for your server. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Django CSRF protection enabled |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Previously, the Strawberry Django view integration was internally exempted from |
|  |  | Django's built-in CSRF protection (i.e, the `CsrfViewMiddleware` middleware). |
|  |  | While this is how many GraphQL APIs operate, implicitly addded exemptions can |
|  |  | lead to security vulnerabilities. Instead, we delegate the decision of adding an |
|  |  | CSRF exemption to users now. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Note that having the CSRF protection enabled on your Strawberry Django view |
|  |  | potentially requires all your clients to send an CSRF token with every request. |
|  |  | You can learn more about this in the official Django |
|  |  | [Cross Site Request Forgery protection documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/csrf/). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To restore the behaviour of the integration before this release, you can add the |
|  |  | `csrf\_exempt` decorator provided by Django yourself: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```python |
|  |  | from django.urls import path |
|  |  | from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf\_exempt |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | from strawberry.django.views import GraphQLView |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | from api.schema import schema |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | urlpatterns = [ |
|  |  | path("graphql/", csrf\_exempt(GraphQLView.as\_view(schema=schema))), |
|  |  | ] |
|  |  | ``` |
