# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in strawberry-graphql

Moderate

[patrick91](/patrick91)
published
GHSA-79gp-q4wv-33fr
Sep 25, 2024

## Package

pip

strawberry-graphql
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<0.243.0

## Patched versions

0.243.0

## Description

### Impact

Multipart file upload support as defined in the [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) was enabled by default in all Strawberry HTTP view integrations. This made all Strawberry HTTP view integrations vulnerable to CSRF attacks if users did not explicitly enable CSRF preventing security mechanism for their servers.

Additionally, the Django HTTP view integration, in particular, had an exemption for Django's built-in CSRF protection (i.e., the `CsrfViewMiddleware` middleware) by default.

In affect, all Strawberry integrations were vulnerable to CSRF attacks by default.

### Patches

Version `v0.243.0` is the first `strawberry-graphql` including a patch. Check out our [documentation](https://strawberry.rocks/docs/breaking-changes/0.243.0) for additional details and upgrade instructions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
