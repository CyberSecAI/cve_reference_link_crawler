Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect privilege assignment within the M-Files Server. Specifically, the "See and undelete deleted objects" permission grants unintended access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The core issue is that a permission intended for managing deleted objects inadvertently grants read access to unmanaged objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with the "See and undelete deleted objects" permission can read unmanaged objects. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege, potentially exposing sensitive data. The CVSS vector indicates a low confidentiality impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
- The attack requires the attacker to have the privilege to "See and undelete deleted objects."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges (PR:H):** An attacker needs to have the "See and undelete deleted objects" permission, meaning they must have high privileges to perform the exploit.
- **User Interaction (UI:R):** User interaction is required, which based on context, could mean the user needs to initiate the action that triggers the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be a user within the affected system or have compromised a user account with the necessary privileges.

**Affected Products:**

- All M-Files Server versions before 22.3.111.64.0 and before 22.3.11237.1.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is related to the "See and undelete deleted objects" permission and its unintended access to unmanaged objects.
- The CVSS score is 2.4, indicating a low severity vulnerability due to the requirement for high privileges and user interaction, coupled with the limited confidentiality impact.
- The identified CAPEC is "Privilege Escalation", but it should be noted this refers to the fact that an existing privilege leads to the ability to read unmanaged objects, not that the exploit escalates privileges further.
