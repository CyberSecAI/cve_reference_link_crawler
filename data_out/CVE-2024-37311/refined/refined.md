{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incomplete verification of the remote host's TLS certificate against the full chain of trust during HTTPS connections from coolwsd to other hosts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incomplete TLS certificate verification",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Man-in-the-middle attacks could potentially be carried out due to the lack of complete verification, allowing an attacker to intercept or manipulate communications between coolwsd and other hosts.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between coolwsd and other hosts."
