The provided content relates to the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-40924.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Display Power Table (DPT) object in the Intel i915 graphics driver could be shrunk while the associated framebuffer was still in use and bound to the DPT's virtual memory (vm) bound list. This led to the system trying to rewrite Page Table Entries (PTEs) using a stale CPU mapping, resulting in a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of DPT object shrinkage when framebuffer is still in use.
- Use of stale CPU mapping.
- Race condition due to the object being shrunk while still in use.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic (Denial of Service).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by shrinking a DPT object while the associated framebuffer is still in use.
- No specific user interaction is mentioned in the content, but the vulnerability can be triggered by normal operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A user with the ability to interact with the i915 graphics driver and trigger a DPT object shrink while the corresponding framebuffer is in use.
