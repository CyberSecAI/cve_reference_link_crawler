Package        : netty
Version        : 1:4.1.33-1+deb10u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-29025
Debian Bug     : 1068110

Julien Viet discovered that Netty, a Java NIO client/server socket framework,
was vulnerable to allocation of resources without limits or throttling due to
the accumulation of data in the HttpPostRequestDecoder. This would allow an
attacker to cause a denial of service.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1:4.1.33-1+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your netty packages.

For the detailed security status of netty please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/netty>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
