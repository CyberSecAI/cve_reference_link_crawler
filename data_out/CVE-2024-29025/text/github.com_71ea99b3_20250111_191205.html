# HttpPostRequestDecoder can OOM

Moderate

[normanmaurer](/normanmaurer)
published
GHSA-5jpm-x58v-624v
Mar 25, 2024

## Package

maven

io.netty:netty-codec-http
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 4.1.108.Final

## Patched versions

4.1.108.Final

## Description

### Summary

The `HttpPostRequestDecoder` can be tricked to accumulate data. I have spotted currently two attack vectors

### Details

1. While the decoder can store items on the disk if configured so, there are no limits to the number of fields the form can have, an attacher can send a chunked post consisting of many small fields that will be accumulated in the `bodyListHttpData` list.
2. The decoder cumulates bytes in the `undecodedChunk` buffer until it can decode a field, this field can cumulate data without limits

### PoC

Here is a Netty branch that provides a fix + tests : <https://github.com/vietj/netty/tree/post-request-decoder>

Here is a reproducer with Vert.x (which uses this decoder) <https://gist.github.com/vietj/f558b8ea81ec6505f1e9a6ca283c9ae3>

### Impact

Any Netty based HTTP server that uses the `HttpPostRequestDecoder` to decode a form.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-29025

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
