- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hidden functionality in the web interface allows access to reserved information through undocumented web applications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Undocumented web applications exist on the device.
    - One endpoint is protected by Basic Authentication, accessible only to users in the "Administration" group.
    - Another endpoint is protected by an undocumented password, accessible only on the QF interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Access to diagnostic information regarding the controller boards.
    - Ability to read and modify serial numbers of various appliance cards.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access via the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Authenticated access to the web interface.
    - For one endpoint, the attacker must belong to the "Administration" group.
    - For the other, the attacker must access the QF interface and know the undocumented password.
