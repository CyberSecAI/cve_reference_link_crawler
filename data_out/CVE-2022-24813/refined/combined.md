# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Description

A locked user reopened request #[2831](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Special%3ARequestWikiQueue/2831) and edited the request various times. The username of the user for some reason is not visible in the wiki request (the requester appears to be one's IP for some reason) but after looking through the Farmer log ([see log from 27 March, 2017](https://meta.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/farmer&offset=20170328013638&type=farmer&user=)), it seems the request was opened by a user named "Hello" ([CentralAuth](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Special%3ACentralAuth/Hello)) who was locked for long-term abuse.

This "Hello" user was locked by NDKilla in \*2017\* and is still locked but they somehow reopened this 5 year old request and when they reopened the request, they did not trigger a log entry in the farmer log saying that they had reopened their request, it just suddenly appeared in the wiki request queue. How could this have happened?

(Task temporarily hidden from public view to prevent a potential Streisand effect)
