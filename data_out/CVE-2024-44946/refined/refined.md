  "cveId": "CVE-2024-44946",
  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "A race condition exists in the Kernel Connection Multiplexor (KCM) module when handling MSG_MORE skbs. Concurrent calls to `sendmsg()` can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to a kernel crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attackVectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by concurrent calls to sendmsg() on a KCM socket with the MSG_MORE flag set.",
     "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to make concurrent `sendmsg` system calls using the Kernel Connection Multiplexor(KCM) module with the `MSG_MORE` flag. This would likely require the ability to create and manipulate sockets and send data over them."
  },
  "patch": {
    "description": "A mutex `tx_mutex` has been added to the `kcm_sock` structure to serialize calls to `kcm_sendmsg()`.",

        "path": "net/kcm/kcmsock.c",
        "changes": [
          "Added `mutex_lock(&kcm->tx_mutex)` at the beginning of `kcm_sendmsg()`.",
           "Added `mutex_unlock(&kcm->tx_mutex)` before returning in both success and error cases within `kcm_sendmsg()`",
