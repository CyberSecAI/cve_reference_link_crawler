Subject: [vim-security] use-after-free in tagstack_clear_entry() in Vim <
 v9.1.0647

use-after-free in tagstack_clear_entry() in Vim
===============================================
Date: 01.08.2024
Severity: Low
CVE: CVE-2024-41957
CWE: Double Free (CWE-415)

When closing a window, the corresponding tagstack data will be cleared
and freed. However a bit later, the quickfix list belonging to that
window will also be cleared and if that quickfix list points to the same
tagstack data, Vim will try to free it again, resulting in a
double-free/use-after-free access exception.

Impact is low since the user must intentionally execute vim with several non-default flags,
but it may cause a crash of Vim.

The Vim project would like to thank github user SuyueGuo for reporting this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0647

Thanks,
Chris
