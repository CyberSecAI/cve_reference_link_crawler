Subject: [vim-security] use-after-free in tagstack_clear_entry() in Vim <
 v9.1.0647

use-after-free in tagstack_clear_entry() in Vim
===============================================
Date: 01.08.2024
Severity: Low
CVE: CVE-2024-41957
CWE: Double Free (CWE-415)

When closing a window, the corresponding tagstack data will be cleared
and freed. However a bit later, the quickfix list belonging to that
window will also be cleared and if that quickfix list points to the same
tagstack data, Vim will try to free it again, resulting in a
double-free/use-after-free access exception.

Impact is low since the user must intentionally execute vim with several non-default flags,
but it may cause a crash of Vim.

The Vim project would like to thank github user SuyueGuo for reporting this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0647

Thanks,

## Package

vim

## Affected versions

< v9.1.0647

## Patched versions

v9.1.0647

## Description

# use-after-free in tagstack\_clear\_entry() in Vim < v9.1.0647

**Date:** 01.08.2024

**Severity:** Low

**CVE:** CVE-2024-41957

**CWE:** Double Free (CWE-415)

### Summary

Vim < v9.1.0647 has double free in src/alloc.c:616.

### Impact

When closing a window, the corresponding tagstack data will be cleared

and freed. However a bit later, the quickfix list belonging to that

window will also be cleared and if that quickfix list points to the same

tagstack data, Vim will try to free it again, resulting in a

double-free/use-after-free access exception.

Impact is low since the user must intentionally execute vim with several non-default flags,

but it may cause a crash of Vim.

The Vim project would like to thank github user SuyueGuo for reporting this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0647

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

patch 9.1.0647: [security] use-after-free in tagstack\_clear\_entry

Problem:  [security] use-after-free in tagstack_clear_entry
          (Suyue Guo )
Solution: Instead of manually calling vim_free() on each of the tagstack
          entries, let's use tagstack_clear_entry(), which will
          also free the stack, but using the VIM_CLEAR macro,
          which prevents a use-after-free by setting those pointers
          to NULL

This addresses CVE-2024-41957
