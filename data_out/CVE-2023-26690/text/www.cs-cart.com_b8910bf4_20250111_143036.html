## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

  Need help? Here are the top questions asked by our Subscribers                Is the CS-Cart platform suitable for starting a marketplace in my country?
                               You can build a multivendor marketplace on the CS-Cart flexible eCommerce platform for e-commerce sales in almost any country. CS-Cart supports multi-currency and it is multilingual, which is great for global multi vendor marketplaces. There are flexible tax and region settings and over 70 payment and shipping options, so you will definitely find the right feature and settings combination for your regional multi-vendor marketplace. Also, CS-Cart is the best multi vendor marketplace software in terms of feature richness.
           Is CS-Cart open source marketplace platform?                               There are a lot of different platforms out there, but here's one thing that sets CS-Cart apart from most of them. CS-Cart Multi-Vendor provides full access to its source code, allowing you to freely modify it, which makes it the best multivendor marketplace platform for custom projects with tight budgets.
           Do you provide hosting services or I should find a 3rd-party hosting provider?                               We basically provide two versions of Multi-Vendor:

* **On-Premises:** a hosted solution, an eCommerce marketplace platform which is installed on your own server. You need hosting for this.
* **No-Code:** a cloud-based marketplace solution hosted on our servers. You don't have to bother about your own hosting. You just sign up and get a marketplace solution deployed in the cloud.

For On-Premises, we provide a specialized cloud hosting from our partners [Scalesta](https://scalesta.com/cloud-hosting-for-cs-cart/) with 24/7 monitoring. We will install the CS-Cart platform for you, make all configurations of the server, and support the server with no extra cost. The pricing for this service starts from $69 per month.

But you're free to use the server of any hosting provider of your choice to build your marketplace on. Just make sure your hosting plans are compatible with [CS-Cart marketplace platform system requirements](https://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/install/system_requirements.html).           Can I order a custom development service from you and how much does it cost?                               To build a custom marketplace, contact our partners. Take a look at the [list of developers in our Marketplace](https://marketplace.cs-cart.com/developers-catalog.html). Please contact them to get a quote for a multivendor marketplace platform modification service.

If you have an in-house custom development team, you can build custom eCommerce business functionality yourselves—the CS-Cart is a **source-available software**. You can integrate third-party services including multiple payment gateways for secure payment processing.

CS-Cart is made in the way that allows for a streamlined development without compromising performance of your business.           Do you have regular obligatory fees or hidden payments?                               CS-Cart is a subscription-based software—the license is renewable. There's also an option to get a lifetime license for a one-time payment.

**No more obligatory or transaction fees are included.** You don't need to pay extra for customer care and upgrades—all these are included in the product subscription.

Regarding the hosting for On-Premises: it's up to you to choose the service provider, just make sure the hosting meets the multivendor marketplace platform requirements so that you could build a multivendor marketplace with fast loading times.           How do you provide technical support and what's included in it?
                               While your product subscription is active, you have free technical support. The level of support depends on your subscription—the more advanced the plan, the more support marketplace features you get. Take a look at the support levels below.

 **Customer Care Standard:**

* **Limited number of support requests.** Basic Customer Care plan with a limited number of requests. Up to 15 requests per month.
* **Website update.** We take care of the whole update routine when new CS-Cart versions come out

**Customer Care Plus:**

* **Unlimited number of support requests.** Ask as many questions as you need.
* **4 free modifications per month.** We make up to 4 minor modifications of the CS-Cart code for your multi vendor website.

           I didn't have enough time to test the demo from A to Z. What are the risks if I buy the license?
                               We offer a **30-day money-back guarantee**, so there are no risks for you. If within 30 days from the moment of purchase you realize that the CS-Cart eCommerce marketplace platform is not what you are looking for and you don't want to build a marketplace on it, you can get a full refund. So, you have pretty much time to text CS-Cart's extensive library of marketplace features and add-ons.           Can I integrate CS-Cart with my existing website?                               We designed CS-Cart to be a standalone marketplace platform in the first place. It guarantees stability, hassle-free configuration, and the uniformity of the marketplace you build.

But it is still possible to integrate the CS-Cart backend with your existing front end since it's an open source platform. CS-Cart also has advanced options like a powerful API support for easy integration. In this case, you'll need to hire developers to build this kind of an integration to meet your business needs. You can not only integrate the CS-Cart marketplace solution backend with the existing front end but also connect any third-party service.

There's also a headless option for large enterprises. Of you're interested, [contact us](https://www.cs-cart.com/contact) for more details on the custom headless solution           Can I enter the license number into the demo and continue using it as my live marketplace?                               Online demo is a temporary installation that is deployed on our servers. It's for demonstration only, consider it a 15-day free trial.

You can't enter the license number into the demo, but it is possible to transfer data from your online demo to a live marketplace.

A personal marketplace demo works for 15 days for demonstration purposes only. If necessary, you can export products, categories, key features, and other data from the demo to your live marketplace.           Can I upgrade my current subscription to an advanced one like Plus or Ultimate?
                               Sure, you can do it on special terms. Moving to a more advanced edition of our multi vendor software is a pretty streamlined process but there could be important nuances in some cases. Please [contact us](https://www.cs-cart.com/contact) for details.           How can I monetize my marketplace? How to attract sellers?                               There are several ways to draw income on your marketplace with the CS-Cart platform once you build it.

Choose any business model that suits you or combine them:

* **Get commissions for every transaction on your digital marketplace:** a vendor sells a product → you get a commission for this sale.
* **Set a fixed monthly fee for selling products on your marketplace:** you can do it via built-in vendor plans.
* **You can advertise** your digital marketplace vendors and increase their sales, which leads to more income.
* **Set a fee for additional marketplace functionality.** For example, setting up an exclusive multi vendor store design or an additional dedicated storefront for a vendor (in Ultimate only).

You can choose any of these options or set all of them at once. One of the most effective tactics for attracting sellers and vendor management is to offer sellers single vendor stores where they can manage orders, catalog, promotions, integrated payment gateways, shipping options, and design.

What's cool about CS-Cart is that you can attract sellers from all over the world, because the platform supports multiple currencies, languages, taxes, and rate areas. Plus, payment integrations that are available in most countries. It's a platform that can help you set global course.
