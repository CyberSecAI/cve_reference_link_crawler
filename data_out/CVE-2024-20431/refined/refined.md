- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper assignment of geolocation data in Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in how the software handles geolocation data, leading to a bypass of access control policies. This is related to CWE-229, which is missing from the official CVE description.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass geolocation-based access control policies and send traffic to protected devices, potentially gaining unauthorized access or disrupting services.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected Cisco FTD device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to an affected Cisco FTD device and no prior authentication is needed.
