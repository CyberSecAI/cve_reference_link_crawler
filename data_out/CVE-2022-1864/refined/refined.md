Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1864:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Use-after-free vulnerability in the WebApp Installs component of Chromium.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Use-after-free: This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to crashes, arbitrary code execution, or other unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   The vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution, which means that an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the affected system, depending on the context in which the browser is running.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is in the WebApp Installs component of Chromium. This indicates that an attacker would likely need to trigger the use-after-free condition through web-based interactions with the application, possibly by manipulating web pages or web application install processes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker would likely need to be able to get a user to interact with a malicious web page or application designed to exploit the use-after-free vulnerability in the WebApp Installs component. The attacker would likely need knowledge of the specific conditions that trigger the use-after-free.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity by the Chrome team.
