- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a client-side prototype pollution in the `core.js` file due to how the `parseQuery` function processes URL query parameters. Specifically, it uses the `getKeyFormat` function to identify keys of the form `aaa[bbb]` and uses the parsed key to set values to the accumulator object. By setting the key to `__proto__`, an attacker can pollute the global JavaScript prototype.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Prototype Pollution (CWE-1321): The ability to modify the `__proto__` property of JavaScript objects, leading to unexpected behavior.
    - DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79): Exploiting the polluted prototype to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code via the `BX.decl` and `BX.render` functions in the `BX.Main.Filter` component.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary JavaScript execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
    - Possible arbitrary PHP code execution (if victim is admin): If the victim has administrator privileges, the attacker can leverage the "PHP Command Line" feature to execute arbitrary system commands on the target web server, leading to complete server compromise.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing specially formed query parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs. The victim needs to visit the crafted URL. No prior authentication is required.
