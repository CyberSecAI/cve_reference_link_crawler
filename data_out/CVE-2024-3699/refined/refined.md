Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-3699:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the "drEryk Gabinet" software. Specifically, the software uses the same hard-coded password for the patients' database across all installations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The software includes a default, unchangeable password within its code, which allows access to the patient database. This violates the principle of least privilege and creates a single point of failure for security.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains knowledge of this hard-coded password can access the patient database.
- This access could lead to the unauthorized retrieval of sensitive data stored in the database. This includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and potentially Protected Health Information (PHI), leading to privacy breaches and potential legal consequences.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to connect to the database. Based on the information provided, it is common for medical facilities to make these databases accessible from the public Internet.
- The attacker would then attempt to connect using the hardcoded password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the hard-coded password.
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the database server. The provided text suggests that these databases are often exposed to the public internet which facilitates remote exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects "drEryk Gabinet" software versions from 7.0.0.0 through 9.17.0.0.
- Version 9.18.0.0 contains a security patch that addresses the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to CERT Polska, which coordinated the disclosure.
- The report indicates that this issue is not unique to drEryk, with similar issues found in other medical software products. This highlights a systemic issue of poor security practices within the medical software sector.
- The advisory also notes that database servers containing sensitive medical data are frequently exposed to the public internet.
- Recommendations include restricting access to databases containing sensitive data to local networks or private networks (VPN) with multi-factor authentication.
- Software vendors are advised to enforce the use of strong passwords by users during initial configuration and allow for password changes.
