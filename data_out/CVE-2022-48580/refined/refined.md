- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "ARP ping device tool" feature in ScienceLogic SL1 takes user-controlled input without sanitization and passes it directly to a shell command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary commands to the underlying operating system. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or destruction, as well as denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the "ARP ping device tool".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low privileged access to the ScienceLogic SL1 platform.
