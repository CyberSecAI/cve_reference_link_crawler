Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses a hardcoded key within the api/config/params.php file for generating access tokens.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Hardcoded cryptographic key.
- Authentication bypass.
- Generation of access tokens using a predictable key.

Impact of exploitation:
- Unauthorized access to admin API endpoints.
- Ability to perform actions with administrative privileges.

Attack vectors:
- Creation of a malicious token using the hardcoded key and a provided python script for token encoding/decoding.
- Usage of the crafted token to bypass authentication.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Access to the hardcoded key (or the means to obtain it).
- Ability to use a script to generate valid tokens.
