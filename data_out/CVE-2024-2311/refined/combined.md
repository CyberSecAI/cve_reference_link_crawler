Avada <= 7.11.6 Contributor+ Stored XSS (on form submission)

# Avada <= 7.11.6 Contributor+ Stored XSS (on form submission)

Exploit Author: Muhammad Zeeshan (Xib3rR4dAr)

### Description

The Avada | Website Builder For WordPress & WooCommerce theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via redirect url in versions up to, and including, 7.11.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user submits the malicious form. By exploiting XSS attacker can perform actions on behalf of other users like create new backdoor admin account when admin views the form.
Redirect url parameter can be set to contain javascript protocol which would allow execution of custom JS when form is submitted.

Steps from Author:

1. Login as author
2. Visit <http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=avada-forms>
3. Enter any name for form and click "Create New Form"
4. In editor, "Text" tab would already be selected, if not then click "Text" tab and paste:

```
[fusion_form_submit]Click here to view content[/fusion_form_submit]

```

5. Click "Confirmation" tab at bottom
6. Change form confirmation type from "Display Message" to "Redirect to URL"
7. Set "Redirect URL" to `javascript:alert('XSS')`
8. Click "Update" and notice form id from URL (post={form\_id})
9. Visit <http://example.com/wp-admin/post-new.php> to create a new post
10. Enter any title for post
11. In editor, "Text" tab would already be selected, if not then click "Text" tab and paste (replace form\_post\_id value with created form):

```
[fusion_form form_post_id="123" /]

```

12. Click "Publish"
13. Visit permalink of form shown below the title
14. XSS will trigger now when any user who visits the form and submits the form by clicking "Click here to view content"

Issue can also be exploited by contributor user but would require high privileged user to approve the form and post.

### Detection

Endpoint: `/wp-admin/post.php`

Parameter `_fusion[redirect_url]` contains `javascript` protocol e.g `_fusion[redirect_url]=javascript:alert('XSS')`

### Fix

Validate and sanitize protocol before redirecting a user

# Avada <= 7.11.6 Contributor+ Stored XSS

Exploit Author: Muhammad Zeeshan (Xib3rR4dAr)

### Description:

The Avada | Website Builder For WordPress & WooCommerce theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via `fusion_builder_column` shortcode in versions up to, and including, 7.11.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
While creating a button, Avada allows to add attributes to a button, which can be exploited to perform XSS. By exploiting XSS attacker can perform actions on behalf of other users like create new backdoor admin account when admin views the form.

`link` parameter/attribute in `fusion_builder_column` shortcode can be set to contain `javascript` protocol which would allow execution of custom JS when column is clicked.

```
link="javascript:alert(&#x27;XSS&#x27;)"

```
### Reproduction Steps:

1. Login as contributor user
2. Visit <http://192.168.253.1/wp-admin/post-new.php>
3. Enter any name for Post Title
4. In editor, "Text" tab would already be selected, if not then click "Text" tab and paste:

```

5. Click "Submit for review"
6. Logout from contributor user
7. Login as administrator user
8. Visit <http://192.168.253.1/wp-admin/edit.php>
9. Click "preview" on post created by contributor user
10. Clicking anywhere inside column, eg on table would trigger XSS.

Author and other users can directly publish a post having XSS in shortcode and then XSS will trigger when any visiting user visits the post and clicks inside the column.

### Fix:

Allow whitelisted protocols like http/https only in `link` attribute of `fusion_builder_column`

### Description

The Avada theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 7.11.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Avada <= 7.11.6 Contributor+ Stored XSS (form submission url)

# Avada <= 7.11.6 Contributor+ Stored XSS (form submission url)

Exploit Author: Muhammad Zeeshan (Xib3rR4dAr)

### Description

The Avada | Website Builder For WordPress & WooCommerce theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via form submission url in versions up to, and including, 7.11.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user submits the malicious form. By exploiting XSS attacker can perform actions on behalf of other users like create new backdoor admin account when admin views the form.
Redirect url parameter can be set to contain javascript protocol which would allow execution of custom JS when form is submitted.

Steps from Author:

1. Login as author
2. Visit <http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=avada-forms>
3. Enter any name for form and click "Create New Form"
4. In editor, "Text" tab would already be selected, if not then click "Text" tab and paste:

```
[fusion_form_submit]Click here to view content[/fusion_form_submit]

```

5. Click "Submission" tab at bottom
6. Clcik "POST" as "Submission Type"
7. Set "Form Submission URL" to `javascript:alert('XSS')`
8. Click "Update" and notice form id from URL (post={form\_id})
9. Visit <http://example.com/wp-admin/post-new.php> to create a new post
10. Enter any title for post
11. In editor, "Text" tab would already be selected, if not then click "Text" tab and paste (replace form\_post\_id value with created form):

```
[fusion_form form_post_id="123" /]

```

12. Click "Publish"
13. Visit permalink of form shown below the title
14. XSS will trigger now when any user who visits the form and submits the form by clicking "Click here to view content"

Issue can also be exploited by contributor user but would require high privileged user to approve the form and post.

### Detection

Endpoint: `/wp-admin/post.php`

Parameter `_fusion[post_method_url]` contains `javascript` protocol e.g `_fusion[post_method_url]=javascript:alert('XSS')`

### Fix

Validate and sanitize protocol before redirecting a user

# Avada <= 7.11.6 Contributor+ Stored XSS

Exploit Author: Muhammad Zeeshan (Xib3rR4dAr)

### Description:

The Avada | Website Builder For WordPress & WooCommerce theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via `fusion_form_submit` shortcode in versions up to, and including, 7.11.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

While creating a button, Avada allows to add attributes to a button, which can be exploited to perform XSS. By exploiting XSS attacker can perform actions on behalf of other users like create new backdoor admin account when admin views the form.

### Reproduction Steps:

1. Login as contributor user
2. Visit <http://127.0.0.1/wp-admin/admin.php?page=avada-forms>
3. Enter any name for form and click "Create New Form"
4. In editor, "Text" tab would already be selected, if not then click "Text" tab and paste:

```
[fusion_form_submit link_attributes="autofocus onfocus=eval(atob(&quot;YWxlcnQoJ1hTUycpOw&quot;))"]Submit[/fusion_form_submit]
```

5. Click "Submit for Review"
6. Logout from contributor user
7. Login as administrator user
8. View form created by user by visiting <http://192.168.253.1/wp-admin/admin.php?page=avada-forms>
9. Clicking "Live Builder" for the form created by contributor user will trigger XSS without further interaction.

Author and other users can also publish a form having XSS in shortcode and then link to a post then XSS will trigger when any visiting user visits the post.
