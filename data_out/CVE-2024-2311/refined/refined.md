Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The Avada theme for WordPress versions 7.11.6 and below is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within various shortcodes. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when the theme renders the shortcode with malicious attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The theme fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `redirect_url`, `post_method_url`, and `link` attributes of certain shortcodes. This allows the injection of malicious code.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The theme does not adequately escape the user-supplied input when it renders it in the HTML output. This allows injected JavaScript code to execute in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users who interact with the vulnerable elements on the page.
*   **Account Takeover:** By exploiting XSS, an attacker can perform actions on behalf of other users, such as creating a new backdoor admin account.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could steal sensitive information, such as session cookies or other data, that can be used for unauthorized access or actions.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could modify the website's appearance or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Redirect URL:** Injecting JavaScript code into the "Redirect URL" field when creating or editing a form. (`_fusion[redirect_url]`)
*   **Malicious Form Submission URL:** Injecting JavaScript code into the "Form Submission URL" field when creating or editing a form. (`_fusion[post_method_url]`)
*   **Malicious `link` Attribute:** Injecting JavaScript code into the `link` attribute of `fusion_builder_column` shortcode.
*   **Malicious `link_attributes` Attribute**: Injecting JavaScript code into the `link_attributes` attribute of `fusion_form_submit` shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:** Attackers need to have at least contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site to create or edit content containing shortcodes.
*   **Ability to create/edit forms and posts:** The attacker must have the ability to create forms (using Avada form builder), or create or edit posts using the WordPress editor.
*   **Social Engineering (in some scenarios):** If an attacker is a contributor and needs a higher privileged user to approve the form or post, they might need to employ social engineering tactics.

**Specific Vulnerable Shortcodes/Features:**

*   `fusion_form_submit`
*   `fusion_builder_column`
*   Avada Form Redirect URL setting
*   Avada Form Submission URL setting

**Technical Details:**

*   The `javascript:` protocol is used to trigger the XSS payload in the redirect URL, form submission URL and link attributes.
*   The `link_attributes` of `fusion_form_submit` shortcode allows for HTML attributes to be inserted which allows for `onfocus` and `eval` to be used to execute the encoded script.

**Fix:**

The fix is to validate and sanitize the protocol before redirecting a user or to only allow whitelisted protocols like `http/https` in the vulnerable attributes of shortcodes.  The vendor released version 7.11.7 which patches these issues.
