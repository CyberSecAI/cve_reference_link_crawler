Avada <= 7.11.6 Contributor+ Stored XSS (fusion\_form\_submit)

 [Raw](/Xib3rR4dAr/8b0f2bf40092e00851fe2f57f15e947e/raw/ce7535c473900cf16427f063f6aab4ed2885863d/Avada_7.11.6_stored_xss.md)

# Avada <= 7.11.6 Contributor+ Stored XSS

Exploit Author: Muhammad Zeeshan (Xib3rR4dAr)

### Description:

The Avada | Website Builder For WordPress & WooCommerce theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via `fusion_form_submit` shortcode in versions up to, and including, 7.11.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

While creating a button, Avada allows to add attributes to a button, which can be exploited to perform XSS. By exploiting XSS attacker can perform actions on behalf of other users like create new backdoor admin account when admin views the form.

### Reproduction Steps:

1. Login as contributor user
2. Visit <http://127.0.0.1/wp-admin/admin.php?page=avada-forms>
3. Enter any name for form and click "Create New Form"
4. In editor, "Text" tab would already be selected, if not then click "Text" tab and paste:

```
[fusion_form_submit link_attributes="autofocus onfocus=eval(atob(&quot;YWxlcnQoJ1hTUycpOw&quot;))"]Submit[/fusion_form_submit]
```

5. Click "Submit for Review"
6. Logout from contributor user
7. Login as administrator user
8. View form created by user by visiting <http://192.168.253.1/wp-admin/admin.php?page=avada-forms>
9. Clicking "Live Builder" for the form created by contributor user will trigger XSS without further interaction.

Author and other users can also publish a form having XSS in shortcode and then link to a post then XSS will trigger when any visiting user visits the post.
