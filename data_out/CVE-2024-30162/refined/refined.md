Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-30162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `IPS\core\modules\admin\editor\_toolbar::addPlugin()` method, specifically in the `toolbar.php` script located at `/applications/core/modules/admin/editor/toolbar.php`.
- This method handles the upload of ZIP files intended to be CKEditor plugins.
- The vulnerability occurs because the method extracts the uploaded ZIP archive's content into the `/applications/core/interface/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/` directory.
- If the ZIP archive does not include a `plugin.js` file, the extracted content is recursively deleted. However, if a `plugin.js` file is present (even if empty), the extracted content, including any PHP files, will remain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows uploading of ZIP files containing arbitrary content, including PHP files.
- **Insufficient File Validation:** The system only checks for the presence of `plugin.js` instead of properly validating the content of the ZIP file.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The system does not sanitize or validate the extracted files before placing them in a publicly accessible location

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious ZIP file containing a `plugin.js` file and a PHP file, an attacker can upload this file, leading to the execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted ZIP file through the vulnerable `toolbar.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Administrator Account:** The attacker needs an administrator account with the "toolbar_manage" permission to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability affects Invision Community versions 4.7.16 and prior.
- There is no official solution available at the time of the advisory.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Egidio Romano.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available at `https://karmainsecurity.com/pocs/CVE-2024-30162.php`.
