------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Invision Community <= 4.7.16 (toolbar.php) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

<https://invisioncommunity.com>

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 4.7.16 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is located in the
/applications/core/modules/admin/editor/toolbar.php script.
Specifically, into the
IPS\core\modules\admin\editor\_toolbar::addPlugin() method, which will
handle
the upload of a ZIP file, trying to extract its content into the
/applications/core/interface/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/ directory; if
the ZIP archive does not include
a plugin.js file, then the extracted ZIP content will be recursively
deleted from the file system,
otherwise it will stay there. This can be exploited to execute
arbitrary PHP code by uploading a
ZIP archive containing a plugin.js file (which can also be empty)
along with a PHP file. Successful
exploitation of this vulnerability requires an Administrator account
having the "toolbar_manage" permission.

[-] Proof of Concept:
