Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11208:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. It stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "copyright information" setting of the Z-BlogPHP administration panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Persistent XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and executed every time a user accesses the website's home page.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode user input before storing it in the database, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary web script execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who visit the affected website.
- **Website defacement:** Attackers can modify the appearance or content of the website.
- **Malicious actions:** Attackers could steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other unauthorized actions on behalf of the users.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Admin panel:** Attackers must first gain access to the Z-BlogPHP admin panel.
- **Copyright information setting:** Once in the admin panel, the attacker can inject the malicious script in the website's copyright information field.
- **Website homepage:** When users access the home page of the website, the malicious script stored in the copyright information will be executed in their browser, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Administrative access:** The attacker must have administrative access to the Z-BlogPHP instance to modify the copyright information setting.

**Additional Details:**

- The developers labeled the issue as "Defrauding CVE", suggesting that it does not qualify for a CVE.
- Issue #205 lists CVE-2018-11208 as one of the fake or duplicated security vulnerabilities the project declined to accept in 2018.
