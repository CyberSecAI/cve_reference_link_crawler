Based on the provided information, all the commits address the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A reference counting issue in the `arm_smmu_rpm_get()` function within the Linux kernel's ARM SMMU (System Memory Management Unit) driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `arm_smmu_rpm_get()` function uses `pm_runtime_get_sync()`, which increases the refcount of the "smmu" device.
- When `arm_smmu_rpm_get()` fails, the caller functions in some error handling paths do not properly decrease the refcount of "smmu", leading to a refcount leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A refcount leak can occur, which can potentially lead to resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through normal system operation via specific error handling paths in the ARM SMMU driver.
- An attacker would need to trigger these error conditions within the driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have a way to cause `arm_smmu_rpm_get()` to fail and be in a position to cause the execution of code within the affected error handling paths.

**Additional details:**
The fix replaces `pm_runtime_get_sync()` with `pm_runtime_resume_and_get()`. This ensures the refcount is balanced even if the function fails.
