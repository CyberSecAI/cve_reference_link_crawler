Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the `contact` parameter from a GET request in `delete-account.php` being directly used in an SQL query without proper validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of sanitization on the `contact` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to perform unauthorized database operations. This could include:
    - Data exfiltration: Extracting sensitive information from the database.
    - Data modification: Altering or deleting data.
    - Authentication bypass: Circumventing login mechanisms.
    - Privilege escalation: Gaining higher access privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted GET request targeting the `delete-account.php` endpoint, where a malicious value is injected into the `contact` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the application's architecture and the SQL database being used.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required to exploit this vulnerability.
