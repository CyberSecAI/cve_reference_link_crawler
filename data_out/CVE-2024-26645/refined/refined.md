Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26645:

**CVE-2024-26645**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `__tracing_map_insert()` function within the Linux kernel's tracing subsystem. Specifically, CPU reordering of write operations during the insertion of a new element into a tracing map leads to duplicates. The check for an existing element and the subsequent write of a new entry are not atomic.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition. Multiple CPUs can simultaneously attempt to insert elements with the same key into the tracing map.
    *   **Lack of Memory Ordering:** The code lacked proper memory ordering primitives between writing the key and publishing the new element, leading to out-of-order visibility on different CPUs.
    *   **Incorrect Duplicate Detection:** The duplicate detection mechanism relied on `READ_ONCE` and a key match check, which was vulnerable to reordered writes.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Duplicate Entries:** The primary symptom of this vulnerability is the creation of duplicate entries in the tracing map, resulting in unexpected warnings.
    *   **Potential Data Corruption:** Although not explicitly stated, duplicate entries could lead to inconsistent data within the tracing system.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The provided example involves the usage of `stress-ng --sysbadaddr $(nproc)`, which could be used to trigger the issue and potentially cause a denial of service of the tracing subsystem due to the repeated warnings being logged.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Concurrent Tracing Map Inserts:** The vulnerability can be triggered by concurrent calls to `__tracing_map_insert()` from different CPUs. This can be achieved by triggering events that cause entries to be made to the tracing map, for example through system calls.
    *   **Triggering Mechanism**: The provided `while` loop triggers the vulnerability by writing to the trigger file and reading the hist file repeatedly. This interaction, when combined with the concurrent bad address system call using `stress-ng`, increases the chances of the race condition occurring.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Multi-processor System:** The vulnerability requires a multi-processor system to trigger the race condition.
    *   **Ability to Trigger Tracing Events:** The attacker needs the ability to generate tracing events, such as system calls, to cause entries to be inserted into the tracing map. The use of debugfs implies the attacker needs some privileges on the system.

**Patch:** The fix involves adding a write barrier (`smp_wmb()`) between writing the key via `memcpy` and making the element visible by using `WRITE_ONCE()` when inserting a new element into the tracing map. This ensures that the key is initialized before the pointer to the new element is published. This makes the insertion atomic from the perspective of other cores, preventing duplicates.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by commit `c193707dde77` which removed the merging of duplicate entries.
*   The fix ensures the correct ordering of writes when adding a new key to the map but does not affect updates to existing entries.
* The fix was backported to several stable kernel branches.
