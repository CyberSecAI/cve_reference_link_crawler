Interim.

**CVEs:** CVE-2021-23839, CVE-2021-23840, CVE-2021-23841

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate OpenSSL. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 prior to 1.0.2y and 1.1.1 prior to 1.1.1j are susceptible to vulnerabilities that may lead to addition or modification of data or Denial of Service (DoS).

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to addition or modification of data or Denial of Service (DoS).

NetApp SANtricity SMI-S Provider and E-Series SANtricity OS Controller Software 11.x are affected by CVE-2021-23840 and CVE-2021-23841.

NetApp Manageability SDK is only affected by CVE-2021-23840. While it does not directly call the affected functions other methods used within NetApp Manageability SDK might.
