  "CVE-2021-23841": {
    "description": "The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The function `X509_issuer_and_serial_hash()` does not properly handle errors when parsing the issuer field of an X509 certificate, which may lead to a null pointer dereference.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Null pointer dereference",
        "Improper error handling"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a maliciously crafted X.509 certificate leading to a crash.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Processing a maliciously crafted X.509 certificate.",
         "Maliciously crafted web content",
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted X.509 certificate."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below",
       "OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below",
       "NetApp products incorporating OpenSSL",
       "Tenable Nessus Network Monitor",
       "macOS Catalina and macOS Mojave WebRTC",
       "iOS 14.6 and iPadOS 14.6 WebRTC",
       "macOS Big Sur WebRTC"
    ],
     "additional_notes": [
        "The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources.",
        "The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms."
