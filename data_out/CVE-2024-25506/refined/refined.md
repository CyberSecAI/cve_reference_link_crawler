- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses the `eval` function to parse the value of the `pm_sys_sys` cookie, which allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the insecure use of `eval` on user-controlled cookie data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can set the `pm_sys_sys` cookie to a malicious payload, and when the user visits the vulnerable page, the JavaScript code will be executed. This can be done by exploiting another vulnerability like XSS, subdomain takeover, or CRLF on the domain where ProcessMaker is hosted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to set the `pm_sys_sys` cookie for a victim's session, which could be achieved through various means like exploiting another vulnerability on the ProcessMaker domain or a subdomain.
