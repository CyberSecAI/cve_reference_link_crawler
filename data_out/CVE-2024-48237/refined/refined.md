The provided content is related to CVE-2024-48237.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `display` and `fetch` methods in `wtcms\application\Common\Controller\HomebaseController.class.php` are not protected, allowing arbitrary file inclusion and code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unprotected methods: The lack of access control on the `display` and `fetch` methods allows them to be accessed without authentication.
- Arbitrary file inclusion: The `fetch` method can be abused to include and execute arbitrary PHP files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by including a malicious PHP file.
- Remote shell: Using file manipulation functions, the attacker can create a backdoor and gain shell access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication needed: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
-  Knowledge of the vulnerability details: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoints and how to exploit them.

**Exploit details:**
The attacker can send a GET request to `http://192.168.0.105:84/index.php?a=fetch&templateFile=public/index&prefix=''&content=<php>file_put_contents('test.php','<?php phpinfo(); ?>')</php>` to create a `test.php` file containing `phpinfo()`. Then, they can access the created file using `http://192.168.0.105:84/test.php` to verify the code execution. This demonstrates the ability to write arbitrary files and execute php code.
