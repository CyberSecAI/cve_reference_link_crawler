Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in multiple locations within the Alkacon OpenCMS 15.0 application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present, both reflected and stored.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   Steal cookies and session tokens.
*   Deface websites.
*   Redirect users to malicious sites.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the search field of a gallery view.
    *   The attacker crafts a payload like `<img src=. onerror=alert(document.domain)>` and inserts this into the search button when viewing an image gallery.
*   **Stored XSS:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the title of a file when renaming.
    *   The attacker crafts a payload like `<img src=. onerror=alert(document.domain)>` and inserts it into the title field when renaming a file.
*   **Stored XSS via SVG upload:** Uploading a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript.
    *   The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file that includes a script, such as the one provided in the POC, which executes when the SVG file is viewed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged into the OpenCMS instance and have the ability to access the file explorer/gallery to perform the attack, as shown by the POC.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to load the crafted pages or interact with the malicious content.
*   **Knowledge of the target:** Attacker needs to have knowledge of how to access the file explorer and edit file names.

**Additional Information:**
*   The exploit-db entry does not reference a CVE ID.
* The vulnerability is present in Alkacon OpenCMS 15.0.
*   Multiple Proof of Concepts (POCs) are provided, showcasing different attack vectors.
*   The content identifies that the exploit is based on XSS.
*   The identified vulnerability is present in the live demo hosted by the vendor.
