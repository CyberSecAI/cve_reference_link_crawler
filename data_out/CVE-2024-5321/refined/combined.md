Subject: [kubernetes] CVE-2024-5321: Incorrect permissions on Windows
 containers logs

Hello Kubernetes Community,

A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes clusters with Windows nodes
where BUILTIN\Users may be able to read container logs and NT
AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users may be able to modify container logs.

This issue has been rated Medium (
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
<<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N>>),
and assigned CVE-2024-5321.

Am I vulnerable?

Any Kubernetes environment with Windows nodes is affected. Run kubectl get
nodes -l kubernetes.io/os=windows to see if any Windows nodes are in use.

Affected Versions

- kubelet <= 1.27.15

- kubelet <= 1.28.11

- kubelet <= 1.29.6

- kubelet <= 1.30.2

How do I mitigate this vulnerability?

This issue can be mitigated by applying the patch provided. The patch
includes changes to pkg/util/filesystem that set file permissions on
Windows and hardens the permissions for container logs for containers
running on Windows.

Fixed Versions

- kubelet 1.27.16

- kubelet 1.28.12

- kubelet 1.29.7

- kubelet 1.30.3

To upgrade, refer to the documentation:
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-upgrade/>

Detection

Any Kubernetes environment with Windows nodes is affected. Run kubectl get
nodes -l kubernetes.io/os=windows to see if any Windows nodes are in use.

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please
contact security@...ernetes.io
