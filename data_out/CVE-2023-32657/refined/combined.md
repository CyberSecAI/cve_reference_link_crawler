### 3.4 RESEARCHER

​Hank Chen (PSIRT and Threat Research of TXOne Networks) reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

​Weintek has updated their account API to v0.13.8, which has fixed the issue. This fix does not require any action for users.

​Additional mitigations are recommended to help reduce risk:

* ​Log in on trusted computers if possible. Log out after usage on un-trusted ones.
* ​On the HMIs, if the online services are not used, set to offline mode for EasyAccess 2.0 or Dashboard services using system reserved addresses.
* ​Regularly change passwords to reduce risks.
* ​Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible- only applicable devices and/or systems have access to the internet.

​CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* ​Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.
* ​When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

​CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

​CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

​Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

​Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

​No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
