- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SB Child List WordPress plugin, in versions 4.5 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper CSRF protection mechanisms within the plugin.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated. The specific impact depends on the actions the targeted user has privileges for.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated, targeted user, would execute actions on the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to click on a crafted link or access a malicious website hosting an exploit. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
