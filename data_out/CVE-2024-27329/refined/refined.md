- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of XPS files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious XPS file or visits a malicious webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious XPS file or trick the user into visiting a malicious webpage. User interaction is required.
