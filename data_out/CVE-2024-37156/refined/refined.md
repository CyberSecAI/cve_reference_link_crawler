Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37156:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `formName` parameter, obtained from the GET request, is not properly sanitized before being used within the HTML input field generated by the `TokenController`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the HTML input field.
- This could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially allowing for session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious URL with a crafted `form` parameter value that includes JavaScript code.
- When a user accesses the vulnerable endpoint with the malicious URL, the injected JavaScript would be rendered and executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the `form` parameter in the GET request.
- The attacker could send a malicious link to a user, or in another situation that would cause the victim to visit the malicious URL.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided code diff shows the fix implemented by using `htmlspecialchars` on both the `formName` and the `csrfToken` before using them in the HTML output.
- The vulnerability was introduced in versions >=2.0.0 of `sulu/form-bundle` and fixed in version 2.5.3
- A workaround involves creating a custom Symfony Request listener to check the `form` parameter and stop the request if it is invalid.
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity, likely due to the attacker needing to craft a URL.
