Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information from the provided text, focusing on CVE-2017-10115:

**CVE-2017-10115**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Timing attack vulnerability in the DSA implementation within the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) component.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Timing Side Channel:** The DSA implementation in Java's JCE is susceptible to timing analysis.  The time it takes to generate DSA signatures varies, and this variance can be observed by an attacker. This timing variation is tied to the private key bits.
    *   **Improper Access Control:** As per the broader context from the provided documents, this vulnerability is related to improper access control issues in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, and JRockit components.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *  **Confidentiality Breach:** By repeatedly making a Java application generate DSA signatures on demand and measuring the response times, an attacker can potentially extract information about the private key. This leads to unauthorized access to sensitive cryptographic information.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a remote attacker with network access.
    *   **Multiple Protocols:** Access can be gained via multiple protocols, indicating a widespread potential for exploitation.
    *   **Timing Analysis:** The attacker would need to be able to cause the target Java application to generate DSA signatures and have a means to measure/analyze response times

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable Java application.
    *  **Ability to Trigger Signature Generation:** The attacker must be able to make the Java application perform DSA signature generation on demand.
    *  **Timing Analysis Capabilities:** The attacker requires the ability to observe and analyze the timing differences in the DSA signature generation process.

**Additional Details from the provided documents:**

*   **Affected Versions**: This vulnerability affects Java SE versions 6u151, 7u141 and 8u131, Java SE Embedded 8u131, and JRockit R28.3.14.
*   **Exploitation Vectors**: It can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets or by supplying data to APIs such as through a web service.
*   **Severity Score**: The CVSS 3.0 base score for this vulnerability is 7.5, with only confidentiality impact being rated as high.
*  **Context**: This CVE is mentioned in multiple sources as part of a larger set of vulnerabilities in Java SE. It's important to note this in terms of the overall impact.
*  **Red Hat & VDE Advisory**: Both Red Hat and VDE specifically highlight this CVE in their advisories related to Java security updates and recommend that users upgrade affected systems.
