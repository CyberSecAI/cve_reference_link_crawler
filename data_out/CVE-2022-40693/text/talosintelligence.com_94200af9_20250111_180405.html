# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1616

## Moxa SDS-3008 Series Industrial Ethernet Switch web application cleartext transmission vulnerability

##### February 2, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-40693

##### SUMMARY

A cleartext transmission vulnerability exists in the web application functionality of Moxa SDS-3008 Series Industrial Ethernet Switch 2.1. A specially-crafted network sniffing can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can sniff network traffic to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Moxa SDS-3008 Series Industrial Ethernet Switch 2.1

##### PRODUCT URLS

SDS-3008 Series Industrial Ethernet Switch - <https://www.moxa.com/en/products/industrial-network-infrastructure/ethernet-switches/layer-2-smart-switches/sds-3008-series>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

5.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

##### DETAILS

The SDS-3008 is an 8-port smart Ethernet switch designed for industrial environments. In addition to standard smart switch functionality such as IEEE 802.1Q VLAN, port mirroring and SNMP, the SDS-3008 also implements variations of EtherNet/IP, PROFINET and Modbus TCP to support management functions by “making it controllable and visible from automation HMIs.” The switch is primarily managed via a web application.

The default configuration of the SDS-3008 web application is configured to transmit credentials in cleartext. Neither the credentials nor the communication channel are encrypted, requiring administrators to explicitly disable unencrypted protocols.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

An example login request is below:

```
POST /loginHistory.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.127.253
Content-Length: 27
Referer: http://192.168.127.253/auth/accountpassword.asp
Connection: close

account=admin&password=moxa

```
### Mitigation

Device administrators can disable the HTTP service in the “Management Interface” section of the web application.
