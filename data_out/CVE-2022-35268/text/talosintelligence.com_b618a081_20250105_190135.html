# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1575

## Robustel R1510 web\_server hashFirst denial of service vulnerability

##### October 14, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-35266,CVE-2022-35265,CVE-2022-35267,CVE-2022-35262,CVE-2022-35261,CVE-2022-35264,CVE-2022-35263,CVE-2022-35271,CVE-2022-35270,CVE-2022-35269,CVE-2022-35268

##### SUMMARY

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the web\_server hashFirst functionality of Robustel R1510 3.1.16 and 3.3.0. A specially-crafted network request can lead to denial of service. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Robustel R1510 3.1.16

Robustel R1510 3.3.0

##### PRODUCT URLS

R1510 - <https://www.robustel.com/en/product/r1510-industrial-cellular-vpn-router/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

4.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-125 - Out-of-bounds Read

##### DETAILS

The R1510 is an industrial cellular router. It offers several advanced software features like an innovative use of Open VPN, Cloud management, data over-use guard, smart reboot and others.

The R1510 uses the embedthis’s GoAhead library for its web server. More specifically it uses version 4.0.0. This version is vulnerable to a denial of service attack, which would result in a crash of the web server.
The library’s `hashFirst` function that is used to traverse a structure of hash keys:

```
WebsKey *hashFirst(WebsHash sd)
{
    HashTable   *tp;
    WebsKey     *sp;
    int         i;

    assert(0 <= sd && sd < symMax);                                                                     [1]
    tp = sym[sd];                                                                                       [2]
    assert(tp);

    /*
        Find the first symbol in the hashtable and return a pointer to it.
     */
    for (i = 0; i < tp->size; i++) {
        if ((sp = tp->hash_table[i]) != 0) {
            return sp;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

```

This function receives as argument a `WebsHash` value, this is practically an identifier for a specific hash table.
The function, at `[1]`, checks using `assert` if the identifier is in a valid range value. The function `assert` is not the standard one that will raise a `SIGABRT`, but one defined in the library:

```
extern void assert(bool cond);
#elif ME_GOAHEAD_DEBUG
    #define assert(C)       if (C) ; else assertError(WEBS_L, "%s", #C)
    PUBLIC void assertError(WEBS_ARGS_DEC, char *fmt, ...);
#else
    #define assert(C)       if (1) ; else {}
#endif

```

Essentially this function will do nothing, possibly calling `assertError`, which will print an error message and continue the execution. So if the `sd` value is not in a valid range, it will reach the instruction at `[2]` anyway. This instruction will use the `sd` value as index of an array. This can cause a segmentation fault, which can lead to the termination of the process.

For instance a pattern that can be found in several `web_server`’s APIs is the following:

```
  is_post = scaselessmatch(webs->method,"POST");
  if (is_post != 0) {
    [...]
    webs_files = hashFirst(webs->files);                                                          [3]
    [...]

```

The API checks if the request is a POST. If so, at `[3]` the files WebsHash is used as argument for the `hashFirst` function. But, if the request didn’t include any files, the `webs->files` value would be -1. Then at `[2]` the value -1 is used to access the array. This can cause a denial of service.
