    "CVE-2021-34735": {
      "root_cause": "Lack of proper rate limiting of ICMP packets on the Ethernet interface.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient rate limiting of ICMP packets"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause the Ethernet IP interface to become unreachable, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The Ethernet port goes offline, the ATA becomes unresponsive over the web management interface, and the Ethernet port loses its IP address association. Manual power-cycle of the device is required to recover.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker sends a crafted, steady stream of ICMP traffic to the IP address of the targeted device over the network.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a crafted stream of ICMP packets to the targeted device IP address."
