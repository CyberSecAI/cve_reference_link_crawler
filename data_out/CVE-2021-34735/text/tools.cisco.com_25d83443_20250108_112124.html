For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ata19x-multivuln-A4J57F3>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ATA 190 Series On-Premises Software or Cisco ATA 190 Series Multiplatform (MPP) Software:    + ATA 190 (On-premises only)   + ATA 191 (On-premises or Multiplatform)   + ATA 192 (Multiplatform only) For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2021-34710: Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter Software Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco ATA 190 Series Multiplatform Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack resulting in remote code execution. It could also allow a lower-privileged user to run commands as an administrative user.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web UI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject commands that will be executed on the underlying OS with *root* privileges. A lower-privileged user could also potentially run commands with the privileges of an administrative user within the web UI.  Bug ID(s): [CSCvx48193](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx48193)Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 8.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2021-34735: Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter Software Denial of Service Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in ICMP packet processing of Cisco ATA 190 Series On-Premises Software and ATA 190 Series Multiplatform Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Ethernet IP interface to become unreachable, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability is due to lack of proper rate limiting of ICMP packets on the Ethernet interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, steady stream of ICMP traffic to the IP address of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Ethernet port to go offline which leads to a DoS condition. The user could observe the PRT LED on the ATA device turning red, the ATA becoming unresponsive over the web management interface and the Ethernet port no longer having an IP address association. This will require a manual power-cycle to recover the device.

Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed firmware release as indicated in the following table:       | Cisco IP Phone Model | Cisco Bug ID | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- | --- |   | ATA 190 Analog Telephone Adapter | [CSCvw25739](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw25739) | [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco ATA 190 Analog Telephone Adapter](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/unified-communications/ata-190-series-analog-telephone-adapters/eos-eol-notice-c51-741354.html#:~:text=Cisco%20announces%20the%20end%2Dof,)%20is%20March%2015%2C%202019.) |   | ATA 191 Analog Telephone Adapter | [CSCvw25740](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw25740) | 12.0(1)SR4 |   | ATA 191 Multiplatform Analog Telephone Adapter | [CSCvx48193](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx48193), [CSCvw22570](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw22570) | 11.2.1 |   | ATA 192 Multiplatform Analog Telephone Adapter | [CSCvx48193](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx48193), [CSCvw22570](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw22570) | 11.2.1 |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.
