{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The i40e driver's XDP program handling logic had a flaw where it would attempt to unload the XDP program while the driver was being removed, which is also part of the driver removal process, leading to a kernel warning and potential issues.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of XDP program during driver removal",
      "Race condition between driver removal and XDP program unloading"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel warning and call stack output to dmesg.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Loading the i40e driver",
      "Loading an XDP program",
      "Unloading the i40e driver (using 'rmmod' command)."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to load and unload kernel modules/drivers and XDP programs.",
     "details": "The commit 6533e558c650 introduced a new PF state \"__I40E_IN_REMOVE\" to block modifying the XDP program while the driver is being removed. This change was only useful if the \".ndo_bpf()\" callback was called out of the rmmod context. Unloading the existing XDP program is part of the driver removal, thus from the rmmod context, the driver is expected to unload the XDP program without reporting errors. The fix introduces a check to see if the XDP program is being loaded or unloaded and blocks only loading a new program while \"__I40E_IN_REMOVE\" is set. Additionally, the test for the \"__I40E_IN_REMOVE\" flag is moved to the beginning of the XDP_SETUP callback."
