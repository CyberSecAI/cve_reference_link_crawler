- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Westermo L210-F2G industrial ethernet switch transmits credentials and session IDs in cleartext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can capture plain text credentials and session IDs by using a network sniffer. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access and control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Adjacent network. An attacker can capture the plain text credentials by sniffing network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the adjacent network and be able to capture network traffic. The user interface being used is also needed.
