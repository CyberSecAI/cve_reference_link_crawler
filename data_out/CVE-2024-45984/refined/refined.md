Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `add_donor.php` page of the Blood Bank And Donation Management System version 1.0. Specifically, the `name` parameter is vulnerable to storing malicious payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The system does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the `name` field before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: When a user visits the `donor_list.php` page, the stored malicious JavaScript payload is executed in the user's browser.
- Potential for various attacks: This could lead to stealing cookies, session hijacking, defacing the web page, redirecting users to malicious sites, performing actions on behalf of the user and more.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web Interface: The attack is performed through the web interface of the Blood Bank And Donation Management System.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to access and interact with the `add_donor.php` page.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter `name` to inject the malicious payload.
