- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, which could be used to perform actions such as stealing cookies or redirecting the user to a malicious site, especially if the victim is a high-privilege user like an admin.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL and tricking a user into accessing it. Specifically, the `editaff` parameter in the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=affiliates_addedit` URL is vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user, especially a high privilege user, to click on the URL. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required but the vulnerable functionality is within the admin panel.
