- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Freesia Empire theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The theme fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, that will be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts through a vulnerable input, which would then be executed when a user visits the website. The specific vector isn't described in detail.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a "Contributor," suggesting they need a user account with certain privileges within the WordPress site.
