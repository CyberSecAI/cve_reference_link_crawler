Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a "broken access control issue," which means there is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check within a function. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:**  The core issue is the failure to properly enforce access controls. This allows users with insufficient privileges to perform actions they shouldn't have permission to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is said to vary, but the general idea is that attackers can perform actions they should not be able to, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or access to data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploitable via a function lacking proper authorization, authentication, or nonce checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user with "contributor" level privileges.
