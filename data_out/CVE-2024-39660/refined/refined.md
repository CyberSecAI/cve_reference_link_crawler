- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Photo Engine WordPress plugin (versions <= 6.3.1) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website, which will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: Through the Photo Engine plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts through the vulnerable plugin. The specific method is not described but requires "Author" privileges, presumably within WordPress.
