Ensure array count consistency in kadm5 RPC

```
In _xdr_kadm5_principal_ent_rec(), ensure that n_key_data matches the
key_data array count when decoding.  Otherwise when the structure is
later freed, xdr_array() could iterate over the wrong number of
elements, either leaking some memory or freeing uninitialized
pointers.  Reported by Robert Morris.

[CVE-2023-36054](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-39q6-4vrm-fv3g "CVE-2023-36054"):

An authenticated attacker can cause a kadmind process to crash by
freeing uninitialized pointers.  Remote code execution is unlikely.
An attacker with control of a kadmin server can cause a kadmin client
to crash by freeing uninitialized pointers.

[Multiple denial of service
vulnerabilities in krb4 KDC](krb4kdc.txt)
A buffer overrun capable of causing a denial of service in
the krb4 KDC compat code was discovered. Additionally,
krb5-1.1.x KDCs with krb4 code enabled are vulnerable to a
separate denial of service.
[Buffer Overrun Vulnerabilities in
Kerberos 4 code](krb4buf.txt)
Serious buffer overruns exist in krb4 compatibility code.
Also, these vulnerabilities likely exist in **almost all
implementations** derived from MIT krb4.

--without-krb4 in 1.1.1](withoutkrb4.txt)
Compiling remote login programs using the --without-krb4

The patches in some of the krb4 overrun original advisories
have been untabified, which causes some people to have trouble
applying them with the patch program. You may use
"patch -l" if your version of patch supports it, or you
may apply one of the patches below.

1. [Update error checking for OpenSSL CMS\_verify](/krb5/krb5/commit/9a2051998c9446f56ba40a29e56c625b83e38467)
    …

   ```
   The code for CMS data verification was initially written for OpenSSL's
   PKCS7_verify() function.  It now uses CMS_verify(), but error handling
   is still done using PKCS7_verify() error identifiers.  Update the
   recognized error codes so that the KDC generates
   KDC_ERR_DIGEST_IN_SIGNED_DATA_NOT_ACCEPTED errors when appropriate.
   Use ERR_peek_last_error() to observe the error generated closest to
   the API surface.

2. [Fix PKINIT CMS error checking for older OpenSSL](/krb5/krb5/commit/a6971d269577afa68584d6076bd90f84c2099f93)
    …

   ```
   Commit [70f61d4](https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/70f61d417261ca17efe3d60d180033bea2da60b0) updated the
   CMS_verify() error code checks, using two error codes new to OpenSSL
   3.0 (RSA_R_DIGEST_NOT_ALLOWED and CMS_R_UNKNOWN_DIGEST_ALGORITHM).
   This change broke the build for OpenSSL 1.0 and 1.1.

   Instead of looking for codes indicating an algorithm issue and
   assuming that everything else is an invalid signature, check for the
   code indicating an invalid signature and assume that everything else
   is an algorithm issue.

   Fix three read overruns discovered by the GitHub Security Lab team

   In get_mech_set(), error out if gss_add_oid_set_member() fails rather
   than continue the loop and increment i past the current bound of
   returned_mechSet.  In g_verify_neg_token_init(), check for zero-byte
   sequences before reading tag bytes, and reduce cur_size by one to
   account for the tag byte when calling gssint_get_der_length().

   ```
   In krb5_dbe_def_encrypt_key_data(), when we free
   key_data->key_data_contents[0], reset it to null so the caller doesn't
   free it as well.

   Since commit [a06945b](https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/a06945b4ec267e8b80e5e8c95edd89930ff12103) this bug
   manifests as a double-free during KDB creation if master key
   encryption fails.

    …

   ```
   Commit [d3356bc](https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/d3356bc42191c1896ab06835a2fb245e00471420) (ticket 8927)
   incorrectly tagged tMERIDIAN as <Number>.  So while the lexer assigns
   meridian values to the Meridian union field, the parser erroneously
   reads them from the Number field.  On 64-bit IBM zSystems (s390x),
   this can result in using the most recently read number as a meridian
   value, leading to an abort in ToSeconds().

   Fix the tMERIDIAN token type to be <Meridian>.

8. [Ensure array count consistency in kadm5 RPC](/krb5/krb5/commit/c81ffb6c8578a9b55c9d0a10342b5bc1bc6ec4df)
    …

   ```
   In _xdr_kadm5_principal_ent_rec(), ensure that n_key_data matches the
   key_data array count when decoding.  Otherwise when the structure is
   later freed, xdr_array() could iterate over the wrong number of
   elements, either leaking some memory or freeing uninitialized
   pointers.  Reported by Robert Morris.

   [CVE-2023-36054](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-39q6-4vrm-fv3g "CVE-2023-36054"):

   An authenticated attacker can cause a kadmind process to crash by
   freeing uninitialized pointers.  Remote code execution is unlikely.
   An attacker with control of a kadmin server can cause a kadmin client
   to crash by freeing uninitialized pointers.

1. [Ensure array count consistency in kadm5 RPC](/krb5/krb5/commit/03561e73371554e163333c1133266292b8936a0f)
    …

   ```
   In _xdr_kadm5_principal_ent_rec(), ensure that n_key_data matches the
   key_data array count when decoding.  Otherwise when the structure is
   later freed, xdr_array() could iterate over the wrong number of
   elements, either leaking some memory or freeing uninitialized
   pointers.  Reported by Robert Morris.

   [CVE-2023-36054](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-39q6-4vrm-fv3g "CVE-2023-36054"):

   An authenticated attacker can cause a kadmind process to crash by
   freeing uninitialized pointers.  Remote code execution is unlikely.
   An attacker with control of a kadmin server can cause a kadmin client
   to crash by freeing uninitialized pointers.

   (cherry picked from commit [ef08b09](https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/ef08b09c9459551aabbe7924fb176f1583053cdd))
