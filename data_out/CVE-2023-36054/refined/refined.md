Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36054:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of array counts within the `_xdr_kadm5_principal_ent_rec()` function during XDR decoding. Specifically, the `n_key_data` field, intended to represent the number of elements in the `key_data` array, is not properly validated against the actual number of elements being decoded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect array count:** The code does not verify that `n_key_data` matches the actual array count when decoding.
- **Uninitialized memory access:** If `n_key_data` is larger than the actual number of key data elements decoded, the `xdr_array()` function may iterate over uninitialized pointers during memory freeing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the `kadmind` process or a `kadmin` client to crash by triggering the freeing of uninitialized memory.
- **Memory leak:** Incorrect array counts could also lead to memory leaks if the xdr_array function does not free all the allocated elements.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `n_key_data` field to provide an invalid value.
- This can occur either by controlling a malicious `kadmin` server (causing a client crash) or by directly targeting a vulnerable `kadmind` server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the kadmin service or have control of a malicious kadmin server.
- **Control over network communication:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted messages containing the malicious `n_key_data` value to the target.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in `src/lib/kadm5/kadm_rpc_xdr.c` file.
- The fix ensures that `n_key_data` matches the actual array count after decoding by assigning `n` (the number of array elements decoded) to `objp->n_key_data`.
- The issue was reported by Robert Morris.
- The vulnerability affects MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) versions prior to 1.20.2 and 1.21.x prior to 1.21.1.
- NetApp products are also affected.
- Debian LTS has issued a security update (DLA 3626-1) to address this issue in krb5.
- The vulnerability is rated as MEDIUM severity with a CVSS score of 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
