Ensure array count consistency in kadm5 RPC

```
In _xdr_kadm5_principal_ent_rec(), ensure that n_key_data matches the
key_data array count when decoding.  Otherwise when the structure is
later freed, xdr_array() could iterate over the wrong number of
elements, either leaking some memory or freeing uninitialized
pointers.  Reported by Robert Morris.

[CVE-2023-36054](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-39q6-4vrm-fv3g "CVE-2023-36054"):

An authenticated attacker can cause a kadmind process to crash by
freeing uninitialized pointers.  Remote code execution is unlikely.
An attacker with control of a kadmin server can cause a kadmin client
to crash by freeing uninitialized pointers.
