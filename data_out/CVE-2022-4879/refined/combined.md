The two biggest changes are making alliance breaks cancel the recall vote, and syncing focus army changes properly, but there's a few bugs fixes as well.

Sorry, something went wrong.

## Features

* ([#4377](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4377), [#4380](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4380)) Improve reclaim overview

  Adjusts the colors, scaling and depth to better represent what is valuable.
* ([#4387](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4387)) Add toggle to enable / disable always showing splash damage

  It is off by default, you can find the toggle in the game options -> interface -> cursor features
* ([#4393](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4393)) Paint feature for observers

  Observers can now paint on the map and other observers can view each others paintings. Useful for

  casting to communicate to your viewers and fellow casters.

  Works by pressing the `ALT` key, can be adjusted in the game options.

  This feature also works in replays.
* ([#4391](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4391)) Improve rendering quality of water

  Slightly adjusts how water looks like in-game to make it look better overall
* ([#4390](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4390), [#4409](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4409)) Add in missing tooltips for game options

  All the game options should now have a consistent tooltip.
* ([#4385](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4385)) Change default aix multiplier values

  Especially the AIs that can be found in the vault become complete beasts when they have

  twice the resources and build time. The default multiplier is now set to 1.5

  Note that you can change the AI multipliers in the lobby options
* ([#4406](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4406)) Prefetch session and unit assets

  Decreases the loading time when launching through the lobby. Assets of units are loaded

  as you play to reduce stuttering of the game.

  This is an experimental change.
* ([#4405](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4405)) Tweak network parameters

  Reduce the amount of lag that players experience by reducing the delay when messages are send.

  This is an experimental change.

* ([#4367](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4367)) Fix the UEF factory unit build animations

* ([#4375](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4375)) Fix TMDs trying to shoot down missiles that are too nearby

  They now have a minimal firing range, it prevents them from trying to hit missiles

  that they can't find a firing solution regardless
* ([#4398](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4398)) Fix and update recall feature

  In particular, fixes a few glitches that people could apply to influence the results.
* ([#4407](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4407)) Scenario Framework GetRandomEntry fix
* ([#4408](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4408)) Slightly reduce mods manager size

* ([#4369](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/pull/4369)) Add guard for validation of LayoutHelpers
