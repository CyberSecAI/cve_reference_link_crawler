- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the failure of IBM DevOps Deploy / IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) to fully invalidate a user's session after logout.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient Session Expiration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user could impersonate another user on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially gain access to a user's session after the user logs out.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have been an authenticated user on the system, and would need to be able to somehow access the still-valid session of another user.
