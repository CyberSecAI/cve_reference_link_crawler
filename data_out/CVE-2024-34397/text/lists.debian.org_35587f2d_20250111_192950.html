Package        : glib2.0
Version        : 2.58.3-2+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-34397

Alicia Boya Garcia reported that the GDBus signal subscriptions in the
GLib library are prone to a spoofing vulnerability. A local attacker can
take advantage of this flaw to cause a GDBus-based client to behave
incorrectly, with an application-dependent impact.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.58.3-2+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your glib2.0 packages.

For the detailed security status of glib2.0 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/glib2.0>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
