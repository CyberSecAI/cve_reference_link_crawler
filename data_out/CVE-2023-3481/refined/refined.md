  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Critters parses HTML, specifically related to critical CSS inlining.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of HTML parsing",
      "CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)",
      "CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to cross-site scripting, potentially allowing an attacker to execute malicious scripts within the user's browser in the context of the vulnerable application.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "The vulnerability is triggered during the HTML parsing process, specifically when Critters inlines critical CSS. An attacker would likely inject malicious code, such as script tags, through some input that is then processed by Critters."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious HTML content that is subsequently processed by the vulnerable Critters library, but no specific elevated permissions or attacker positioning are specified beyond this. The precise mechanism for injection isn't specified in the provided text."
