Caution

**Snipe-IT now requires PHP 8.1.2 or greater**

Hey everyone!

While this is just a point release, we're really excited for this one. We've a bunch of small bug fixes, but also added some UX sugar that we think will make everyone's workflows a little bit easier. You can now decide where you want to go after creating, editing, or checking in/out a first class object (Assets, Accessories, Licenses, Users, etc). You can also now check out more than one accessory at a time, if that's a thing that comes up in your workflow.

Also: If your table listings text ("Showing x of y pages") defaulted to Chinese, this release handles that (via [#15133](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15133)).

We've been doing a ton of under the hood stuff that won't seem very obvious as users, but it puts us in a much better position to move more quickly on a lot of things.

Another important technical note: this release mitigates a difficult to exploit but possible attack. If someone had access to your `APP_KEY`, it was possible to perform an RCE attack. We mitigated this by disabling cookie serialization, but I'd still argue that if someone has your `APP_KEY`, you're going to have a bad time in a bunch of other ways, so this is just a gentle reminder than your APP\_KEY should never, ever be shared with anyone, for any reason, and you should never use the default `APP_KEY` values we have in some of our example env files. If you have encrypted custom fields and need to roll your `APP_KEY` because you feel it could have been compromised, [we have a cli utility to handle that](https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/key-rotation).

Next up: Custom fields for users, and the ability to check out accessories to assets and locations.
