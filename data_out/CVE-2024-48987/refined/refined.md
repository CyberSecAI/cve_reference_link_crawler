The provided content is related to CVE-2024-48987.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the potential exploitation of the `APP_KEY` within the Snipe-IT application, specifically how it was used with cookie serialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Insecure Cookie Serialization:** The application was vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack if an attacker gained access to the `APP_KEY`, due to the ability to serialize cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker with access to the `APP_KEY` could execute arbitrary code on the server.
-  **Data Compromise:**  If custom fields were encrypted, the `APP_KEY` could be used to compromise this encryption.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **Compromised `APP_KEY`:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker obtaining the `APP_KEY`. This could be achieved through various means, such as unauthorized access to server configuration files, or exploitation of another vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Access to `APP_KEY`:** An attacker needs access to the `APP_KEY` to exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Snipe-IT application to send malicious requests.

**Mitigation:**
-   **Disabled Cookie Serialization:** The vulnerability is mitigated by disabling cookie serialization within the Snipe-IT application.
-   **Key Rotation:** The application offers a CLI utility to handle `APP_KEY` rotation to mitigate the impact of a compromised key.
-   **Secure Key Storage:** The documentation stresses that the `APP_KEY` should never be shared and that default keys should never be used.
