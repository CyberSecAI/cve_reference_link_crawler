# Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information

published
GHSA-77gj-crhp-3gvx
Aug 20, 2024

## Package

nuget

Umbraco.Cms
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

> 14.0.0

## Patched versions

14.1.2

## Description

### Impact

Some endpoints in the Management API can return stack trace information, even when Umbraco is not in debug mode.

### Explanation of the vulnerability

Management API endpoints leaked stack traces in case of Internal server errors, no matter if the debug setting was disabled.

E.g. when paging with negative numbers in some apis

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
