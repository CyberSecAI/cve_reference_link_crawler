```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied post meta when using the 'cpt' shortcode.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages, executing whenever a user accesses an injected page. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, data theft, or further propagation of attacks.
- Attack vectors: By injecting malicious scripts through the plugin's 'cpt' shortcode, which processes user-supplied post meta without proper sanitization/escaping.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Authenticated users with contributor-level permissions or higher.
