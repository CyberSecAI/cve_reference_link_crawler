# Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') in hyper-bump-it

Low

[plannigan](/plannigan)
published
GHSA-xc27-f9q3-4448
Sep 3, 2023

## Package

pip

hyper-bump-it
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<0.5.1

## Patched versions

0.5.1

## Description

### Summary

`hyper-bump-it` reads a file glob pattern from the configuration file. That is combined with the project root directory to construct a full glob pattern that is used to find files that should be edited. These matched files should be contained within the project root directory, but that is not checked. This could result in changes being written to files outside of the project.

The default behaviour of `hyper-bump-it` is to display the planned changes and prompt the user for confirmation before editing any files. However, the configuration file provides a field that can be used cause files to be edited without displaying the prompt.

### Details

The vulnerability is present in

[hyper-bump-it/hyper\_bump\_it/\_hyper\_bump\_it/files.py](https://github.com/plannigan/hyper-bump-it/blob/49c726201bbdc02c052302e03fd907d2170e1f47/hyper_bump_it/_hyper_bump_it/files.py#L35)

Line 35
in
[49c7262](/plannigan/hyper-bump-it/commit/49c726201bbdc02c052302e03fd907d2170e1f47)

|  | for file in project\_root.glob(config.file\_glob) |
| --- | --- |

That code joins the project root directory with a string read from the configuration file without checking if the final path is located outside the project root directory.

The following configuration file contents would cause `hyper-bump-it` to replace every instance of "hello" in every file adjacent to the project root directory with "world". The line setting `show_confirm_prompt` to `false` is not required, but will result in the user file edits to occur without the user having a chance to reject the changes (The fact that changes happened would still be displayed).

```
[hyper-bump-it]
current_version = "1.2.3"
show_confirm_prompt=false

[[hyper-bump-it.files]]
file_glob = "../*"
search_format_pattern = "hello"
replace_format_pattern = "world"
```
### Patches

A fix that been released as part of v0.5.1. The changes can be view as part of PR [#307](https://github.com/plannigan/hyper-bump-it/pull/307).

### Workarounds

Users that are unable to update from vulnerable versions, executing `hyper-bump-it` with the `--interactive` command line argument will ensure that all planned changes are displayed and prompt the user for confirmation before editing any files, even if the configuration file contains `show_confirm_prompt=true`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
