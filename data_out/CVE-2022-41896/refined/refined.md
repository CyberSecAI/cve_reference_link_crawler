{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `tf.raw_ops.Mfcc` operation in TensorFlow crashes when the `filterbank_channel_count` parameter is set to a value greater than the maximum allowed size by the internal `MfccMelFilterbank` class.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `MfccMelFilterbank` class in TensorFlow was not properly checking the requested `num_channels` against the maximum allowed size, leading to a potential crash due to memory allocation failure when creating the `center_frequencies_` vector. Specifically, the code was not checking if `num_channels + 1` exceeded the maximum size of `std::vector<double>` or `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`. This could lead to an integer overflow or a failed memory allocation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A specially crafted input with an extremely large value for `filterbank_channel_count` can cause a denial of service by crashing the TensorFlow process using the `tf.raw_ops.Mfcc` operation.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a large integer value to the `filterbank_channel_count` parameter of the `tf.raw_ops.Mfcc` operation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to provide input to a TensorFlow model using the vulnerable `tf.raw_ops.Mfcc` operation. No special privileges are required."
