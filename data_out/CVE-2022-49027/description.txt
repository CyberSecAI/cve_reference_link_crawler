In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iavf: Fix error handling in iavf_init_module()

The iavf_init_module() won't destroy workqueue when pci_register_driver()
failed. Call destroy_workqueue() when pci_register_driver() failed to
prevent the resource leak.

Similar to the handling of u132_hcd_init in commit f276e002793c
("usb: u132-hcd: fix resource leak")
