{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the usage of the `strcpy` function in `parseUrlAddrFromRtspUrlString` without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious game streaming server can exploit this buffer overflow to cause a crash on the moonlight client, or achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, as the malicious server sends a specially crafted RTSP URL string to the client. This occurs after the pairing process and thus requires the user to be tricked into pairing with a malicious host.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a game streaming server that the client connects to and send a specially crafted RTSP URL. The attack requires the client to have a video bitrate of at least 15Mbps, and to have paired with the malicious server."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "vulnerable_function": "`parseUrlAddrFromRtspUrlString` in `RtspConnection.c`",
    "vulnerable_code_description": "The RTSP URL string received from the server is copied into `urlAddr`, a static buffer of length 48, using `strcpy`. The server can provide an arbitrarily long string, causing a buffer overflow.",
     "patched_version": "The vulnerability was fixed in commit `02b7742f4d19631024bd766bd2bb76715780004e` by replacing the vulnerable `strcpy` function with a safe version `PltSafeStrcpy` and adding a size parameter to `parseUrlAddrFromRtspUrlString`.",
    "affected_versions": "Multiple Moonlight client versions are affected, including iOS/tvOS (v8.4.0 to v8.5.0), Android (v10.10 to v11.0), Chrome (v0.10.22), Embedded (v2.6.0), Xbox (v1.12.0 to v1.14.4.0), TV (v1.5.4 to v1.5.27), Switch (v0.13 to v0.13.3) and Vita (v0.9.2 to v0.9.3).",
    "poc": "A Python webserver can be used to simulate the gamestream server and serve the exploit. The steps to set it up are included in the provided content."
