Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a boolean-based SQL Injection. The `$tagId` variable, which is obtained from the `tid` parameter in the HTTP request, is directly embedded into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **SQL Injection:** The code directly concatenates the user-supplied `$tagId` into the SQL query string in `web/ajax/event.php`, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, this occurs in the following line: `$sql = "SELECT * FROM Events_Tags WHERE TagId = $tagId";`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Total control of SQL Databases:** Successful exploitation can lead to loss of data confidentiality and integrity, as well as denial of service. An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify existing records, or disrupt the service by executing commands like `SLEEP`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP requests. The attacker can craft a malicious `tid` parameter value within a request to `/zm/index.php?view=request&request=event&action=removetag`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the ZoneMinder instance. The vulnerability can be triggered through an authenticated session, so an attacker would likely need low-level privileges. No user interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploit using sqlmap.
- The fix involves using parameterized queries, where the user-supplied input is passed as a parameter to the database query instead of being directly embedded into the SQL string, mitigating the SQL injection risk by properly sanitizing user input via the `validCardinal()` function or by using `dbNumRows` with parameter binding.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS score of 10.0.
- The vulnerable versions are ZoneMinder 1.37.* up to and including 1.37.64, and it has been patched in version 1.37.65.
- The affected component is `/web/ajax/event.php`
