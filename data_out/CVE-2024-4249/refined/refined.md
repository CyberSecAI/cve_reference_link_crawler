Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a stack buffer overflow in the `formwrlSSIDget` function of the Tenda i21 router firmware. The function uses `sprintf` to construct a string based on user-provided input without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack buffer overflow:** The `mib_prefix` buffer is overflowed when a user-controlled `ssidIndex` parameter is too large, leading to a buffer overflow. Specifically, the `sprintf(mib_prefix, "wl2g.ssid%s.", index);` is vulnerable.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code does not properly validate or sanitize the `ssidIndex` parameter, allowing an attacker to supply arbitrary lengths, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code execution:** The stack buffer overflow can allow an attacker to overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the router.
- **Denial of Service:** Overwriting parts of the stack could also crash the device, leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/wifiSSIDget` endpoint.
- **`ssidIndex` parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `ssidIndex` parameter within the POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, implying that the attacker has network access to the device, most likely being on the same local network.
- **Understanding of API:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and the parameters it accepts.

**Additional details:**
- The content provides specific firmware version, `i21 V1.0.0.14(4656)`, for which the vulnerability exists
- It gives a basic proof-of-concept (POC) Python script that can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- The provided images appear to be screenshots of the vulnerability or the code snippets that are related to the vulnerability but these are not critical for the analysis.
