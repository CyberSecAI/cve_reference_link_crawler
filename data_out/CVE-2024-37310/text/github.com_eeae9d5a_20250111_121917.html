# Integer overflow in the "v2g\_incoming\_v2gtp" function

Critical

[Pietfried](/Pietfried)
published
GHSA-8g9q-7qr9-vc96
Jul 10, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 2024.6.0

## Patched versions

2024.3.1 , 2024.6.0

## Description

### Summary

An integer overflow in the "v2g\_incoming\_v2gtp" function in the v2g\_server.cpp implementation can allow a remote attacker to overflow the process' heap

### Details

In the V2G server implemented in "modules\EvseV2G\v2g\_server.cpp" the "v2g\_incoming\_v2gtp" function appears to contain an integer overflow after reading the V2GTP 4-bytes header:

```
rv = read_v2gtpHeader(conn->buffer, &conn->payload_len);
if (rv == -1) {
    dlog(DLOG_LEVEL_ERROR, "Invalid v2gtp header");
    return -1;
}

if (conn->payload_len + V2GTP_HEADER_LENGTH > DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE) {
    dlog(DLOG_LEVEL_ERROR, "payload too long: have %d, would need %d", DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE,
         conn->payload_len + V2GTP_HEADER_LENGTH);

    /* we have no way to flush/discard remaining unread data from the socket without reading it in chunks,
     * but this opens the chance to bind us in a "endless" read loop; so to protect us, simply close the connection
     */

    return -1;
}
/* read request */
rv = connection_read(conn, &conn->buffer[V2GTP_HEADER_LENGTH], conn->payload_len);
```

Providing any value between [0xFFFF FFF8, 0xFFFF FFFF] in these 4 bytes as part of the V2GTP header will cause the check in line 165 to pass.

And since that large length is later passed to "connection\_read", the server will accept any number of bytes to the heap buffer "con->buffer",

thereby overflowing the heap.

### PoC

This can reproduced when the EvseV2G module is running and sending the following `nc` command will trigger the bug (IPv6 address may change of course)

`$ python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'\x01\xFE\x80\x01\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF' + b'A'*0x3000)" | nc -6 -v fe80::215:5dff:fe2e:ea25%2 61341`

### Impact

Remote code execution is definitely possible from overwriting the heap in a standard Linux process, exploitation feasibility is still being investigated however an immediate crash can be observed by triggering the vulnerability with the `nc` command specified above.

Because of that, "Attack Complexity" is marked as "High" for the CVSS 3.1 score

### Patch

This vulnerability has been fixed with [f73620c](https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/commit/f73620c4c0f626e1097068a47e10cc27b369ad8e) which is included in the releases <https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/releases/tag/2024.3.1> and <https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/releases/tag/2024.6.0> .

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
