Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `query_data` method within the Analytics Dashboard integration, which is used to fetch data from `Cube`. The method sets `allow_local_requests: true` and constructs the target URL using the user-controlled `cube_server_url`. This allows an attacker to redirect requests to arbitrary internal services, including localhost, bypassing intended access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes HTTP requests to a URL controlled by the user, allowing the attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary locations.
*   **Bypass of Localhost Restrictions:**  The `allow_local_requests: true` flag explicitly enables requests to localhost even when such access should be restricted.
*   **Full Read SSRF:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to read the full response from the targeted service.
*   **GET and POST SSRF:**  The attacker can control whether the redirected request uses a GET or POST method, by exploiting HTTP redirects (301 for GET, 307 for POST).
*   **Error Response Disclosure:** When the requested internal service does not respond with JSON, the error message returned to the user contains the full content from the response, leaking information to the attacker.
*   **User Controlled URL:** The `cube_server_url` parameter is controlled by the user, allowing for manipulation to achieve the attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read responses from internal services, potentially gaining access to sensitive data and configuration information not intended for public access.
*   **Internal Port Scanning:** An attacker can use the vulnerability to scan internal services for open ports, gaining further knowledge of the target infrastructure.
*   **Potential for Integrity Impact:** While the primary demonstrated impact is information disclosure, the POST SSRF capability could potentially be used for write operations (e.g. modifying internal system state if a vulnerable service is found), though this is not explicitly demonstrated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated `Cube API URL`:** The attacker crafts a malicious `Cube API URL` that redirects requests to the targeted internal service.
*   **HTTP Redirects:** The attacker uses a server under their control to send HTTP redirects (301 or 307) to force the vulnerable application to send requests to internal URLs.
*   **Analytics Dashboard Integration:** The vulnerability is exploited via the Analytics Dashboard configuration within GitLab.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GitLab User Account:** The attacker needs an account with sufficient permissions to configure the Analytics Dashboard integration. Specifically, an Ultimate subscription is required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to interact with the GitLab instance and also to set up their redirection server.
*   **Redirection Server:** The attacker needs access to a server under their control, capable of generating HTTP redirects to internal targets.
* **Understanding of HTTP Redirects:** The attacker needs understanding of how HTTP redirects can be used to manipulate request methods (GET/POST).
