### [Ok plugin, poor support](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/decent-plugin-poor-support/)

I purchased Pro primarily to upload multiple images at once because i liked the way the plugin functioned given what I was looking for in a gallery plugin.
However, the support is non-existent, the plugin is buggy when maintaining (adding/deleting) galleries, and better functionality can be found in other plugins without paying for the lack of support and issues.
