{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `/api/v1/openai-assistants-file` endpoint in `index.ts` is vulnerable to arbitrary file read due to lack of sanitization of the `fileName` body parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary File Read",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a POST request to `/api/v1/openai-assistants-file` with a crafted `fileName` parameter in the request body.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can send arbitrary POST requests to the Flowise server if the default unauthenticated configuration is used."
