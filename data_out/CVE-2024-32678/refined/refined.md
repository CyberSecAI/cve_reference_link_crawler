- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact can vary based on the affected function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing functions that lack proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable function without needing any authentication or specific privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
