- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the SOAP API interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected D-Link DIR-2150 router.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present in the SOAP API interface, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. Attackers can send crafted requests to this interface to inject commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device and does not require authentication.
