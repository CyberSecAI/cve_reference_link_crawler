The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41955.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an open redirect issue in the MobSF authentication view, where the `next` parameter in the login URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary website after successful login.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open Redirect vulnerability
- Inadequate sanitization of the `next` parameter in login and SAML authentication views
- Lack of proper validation of redirect URLs
- The application trusts user-provided input in the `next` parameter to construct redirect URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website after successful login, potentially leading to phishing attacks or further compromise.
- Successful redirection can lead to the theft of user credentials or other sensitive information.
- The attacker could also attempt to launch a social engineering attack.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through crafted URLs, specifically by manipulating the `next` parameter in login and SAML authentication requests.
- A network-based attack vector is used where a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a crafted `next` parameter.
- The attacker does not need any specific access to the MobSF instance other than access to the login page.
- The attacker needs the target user to click on a manipulated link.
