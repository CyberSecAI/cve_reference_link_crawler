- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An encrypted ElasticSearch password is included in debug log files when FortiSIEM is configured with ElasticSearch Event Storage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insertion of sensitive information into log files (CWE-532).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can view the encrypted ElasticSearch password by accessing debug log files. This leads to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of FortiSIEM with access to the debug log files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges within FortiSIEM and have the ability to access the log files where the encrypted password is being logged.
