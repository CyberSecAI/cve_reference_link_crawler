- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious link or embedding a form in a website, an attacker could trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to interact with the malicious content. The user must have an active session with the vulnerable WordPress site.
