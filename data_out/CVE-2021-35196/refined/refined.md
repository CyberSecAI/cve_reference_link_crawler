Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insecure deserialization of project settings using the `pickle.loads()` function in `settings.py`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The application uses the Python `pickle` module to deserialize project settings. The `pickle` module is known to be insecure and can lead to arbitrary code execution if used on untrusted data.
*   The application does not properly validate the project file format and version. By crafting a project without a `MANUSKRIPT` or `VERSION` file, an attacker can force the application to use the vulnerable version 0 settings loading logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
*   An attacker can execute any code they desire on a system opening a specially crafted project file. This could lead to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Malicious project files can be shared online, sent via email, or distributed through any other means.
*   An attacker can craft a malicious project zip file containing a `settings.pickle` file with a malicious payload. The victim only needs to open the malicious project file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a malicious project file (e.g., a ZIP file) containing a specially crafted `settings.pickle` file.
*   The attacker must convince the victim to open the malicious project file using the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects older versions of the application where the settings are loaded using the pickle library. Newer versions use json which mitigates the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable code was located in `loadSave.py`, `version_0.py`, and `settings.py`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by removing the insecure pickle setting files and was addressed in pull request #895.
*   A sample exploit using a reverse shell is given in the provided content.
