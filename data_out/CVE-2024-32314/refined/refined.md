Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a command injection in the `formexeCommand` function of the Tenda AC500 router firmware.
- The `cmdinput` parameter from the user is directly passed to `cmd_buf` variable and then used in `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the system via the `cmdinput` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The firmware does not sanitize or validate user-supplied input, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the router.
- **Complete System Compromise:** This level of access could allow attackers to take complete control of the device, potentially leading to:
  - Data theft
  - Malware installation
  - Botnet inclusion
  - Denial of service
  - Further network compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/exeCommand` endpoint.
- **`cmdinput` Parameter:**  The `cmdinput` parameter in the POST request contains the injected command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Tenda AC500 router (e.g., on the same LAN, or through a compromised network).
- **Basic Web Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP POST request with the crafted payload.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Firmware Version:** AC500 V2.0.1.9(1307)
- **Proof of Concept (PoC) provided:** The content includes a Python PoC script demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using `requests` library to send a POST request with the injected command `ls;`.
- The code snippets show the vulnerable code path in `formexeCommand` function, where the user-provided `cmdinput` is assigned to `str` variable which then assigned to `cmd_buf` variable and used in `doSystemCmd` function without any sanitization
