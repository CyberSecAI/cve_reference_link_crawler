{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Docker Desktop installer on Windows was vulnerable to DLL side-loading, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite administrator files with their own malicious code during the installation or upgrade process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "DLL side-loading"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary file overwrite, potentially allowing local privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Malicious DLLs placed in the same directory as the Docker Desktop installer.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to place malicious DLLs in the same directory as the installer."
