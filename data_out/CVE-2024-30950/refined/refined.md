- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when executing SQL queries through the `admsql.php` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application. These scripts can then be executed by other users who visit the affected pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must be logged in as an administrator and use the `admsql.php` page to inject malicious javascript code as a SQL query. The injected payload will be stored and executed when the administrator goes to the `admerr.php` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs administrator access to the FUDforum application.
