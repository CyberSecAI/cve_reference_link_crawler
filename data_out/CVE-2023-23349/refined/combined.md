## **Advisory issued on November 1, 2022**

### Description

Kaspersky team has fixed three security issues in the installers of Kaspersky products for home, the Kavremover tool, and Kaspersky Endpoint Security.

* Two reported issues relate to two executables from the products’ installers that could be utilized separately from the product. This security issue allowed an attacker to legitimately run a third-party executable in the context of the installation process. We access the severity of these issues as Low.
* The third issue allowed an attacker to unnoticeably run an adversarial executable instead of running the uninstaller intended to remove the third-party security products when installing Kaspersky solutions. To exploit this issue, the attacker needed administrator rights and had to create registry keys pointing to the file they wanted to execute. We access the severity of this issue as Low.

### Recommendations

We recommend our customers to use the latest versions of the installers from our website. The users of already installed products are not affected by these issues. Also, we recommend the users who can’t use the latest versions of the installers to follow [these instructions](https://support.kaspersky.com/KESWin/11.8.0/en-US/123468.htm).

## **Phishing advisory issued on November 1, 2021**

### Phishing emails seemingly coming from a Kaspersky email address

Kaspersky security experts have recently seen a huge uptick in spearphishing emails designed to steal Office 365 credentials. These phishing attempts rely on a phishing kit we named “Iamtheboss” used in conjunction with another phishing kit known as “MIRCBOOT”. The activity may be associated with multiple cybercriminals. The phishing e-mails are usually arriving in the form of “Fax notifications” and lure users to fake websites collecting credentials for Microsoft online services. These emails have various sender addresses, including but not limited to noreply@sm.kaspersky.com. They are sent from multiple websites including Amazon Web Services infrastructure.

The example of the email is below:

![Phishing email example](https://img.kaspersky.com/kb/en-global/284592_535355_common_12430_01.png "Phishing email example")

We encourage users to execute caution and be vigilant even if the email seems to come from a familiar brand or email address. The detailed how-to on checking email headers to ensure senders’ identity is posted on the [Kaspersky blog](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/analyzing-mail-header/42665/).

During the investigation of this phishing activity, Kaspersky experts determined that some e-mails were sent using Amazon’s Simple Email Service (SES) and legitimate SES token. This access token was issued to a third party contractor during the testing of the website 2050.earth. The site is also hosted in Amazon infrastructure. Upon discovery of these phishing attacks, the SES token was immediately revoked. No server compromise, unauthorized database access or any other malicious activity was found at 2050.earth and associated services.

## **Advisory issued on November 1, 2021**

### Description

## **Advisory issued on 26th February, 2020**

### Description

Kaspersky has fixed a security issue in consumer and corporate products that was publicly disclosed earlier. A component responsible for interprocess communications was vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to weak check of incoming data in some specific cases. Depending on the product, this could allow an attacker to elevate privileges in the OS, provided that the vulnerable component works within the context of process with high privileges. At the moment of exploitation an attacker must be already authenticated in the system (local attack). In case of such products as consumer Kaspersky Anti-Virus products family and Endpoint Security, an attacker also needs to bypass product's self-defense to perform exploitation.

## **Advisory issued on 22th March, 2017**

### **Description**

Kaspersky Lab has fixed a vulnerability found by Cybellum Technologies which made a DLL Hijacking attack possible, via an undocumented feature of Microsoft Application Verifier. This allows the attacker to inject code into most OS processes, not just security solutions. It should be mentioned that this attack can only be performed thorough a local vector, when the attacker has already penetrated the device. The attacker has to infect the attacked computer with malicious software in advance, and escalate its privilege on the device in order to register a new Application Verifier Provider DLL – both actions require an attacker to use a range of other tools.

### **Fixed Versions**

The detection and blocking of this malicious scenario has been added to all Kaspersky Lab products from 22 March. In order to stay protected, Kaspersky Lab recommends all customers keep their security solutions up to date and do not disable behavior-based detection features.

Kaspersky Lab will also incorporate additional protection measures into the next updates to its flagship security products. These will block the attack attempts described at different levels. The security solutions to be updated accordingly are:

* Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2018
* Kaspersky Internet Security 2018
* Kaspersky Total Security 2018
* Kaspersky Small Office Security 2018

## **Advisory issued on 28th December, 2016**

### **Description**

Kaspersky Lab has fixed a number of vulnerabilities found by Mr. Tavis Ormandy:

* Specific scenarios existed when unprivileged user might read file with a private key created by product for managing SSL connection. This could be used by attacker/malware with access to a host in order to obtain this file to perform targeted attacks on SSL connections initiated by browser application on the host.
* If user navigated to a web site with invalid SSL certificate and decided to trust it by selecting Continue on the product's warning in order to access the site, product added the certificate to trusted root incorrectly. That might be used by attacker to skip invalid certificate warning if user access sites that were listed in Subject Alternative Names of the original invalid SSL certificate.
* SSL certificate caching error existed that might be used by attacker with a control of network in order to perform targeted attack on a host to intercept SSL connections initiated by browser application specifically by using IP address instead of a domain name.

## **Advisory issued on 24th December, 2015**

### **Description**

Kaspersky Lab has identified that below mentioned products are susceptible to memory corruptions, while scanning malformed files of RAR format. These vulnerabilities have maximum security impact of remote code execution and could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the Antivirus process. In order to exploit the vulnerabilities an attacker should convince user to upload maliciously malformed RAR file from external resources. This, for example, might be done by convincing a user to download malicious file from specially crafted website or by sending him a malicious file via e-mail. Memory corruptions might possibly occurred while scanning this file. The fix addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying processing of malformed RAR format. CVSS Score: 6.8 ([AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2&vector=%28AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P%29))

### **Description**

Kaspersky Lab has fixed a number of vulnerabilities found by Mr. Tavis Ormandy:
- ACL on Kaspersky's directory allowed unprivileged users to create a new file in ProgramData system folder. This could be used by attackers with access to a host in order to create a malicious file that might be then loaded by Antivirus process. CVSS score of this vulnerability is 4.1 ([AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2&vector=%28AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P%29)).
- X.509 certificates handling was vulnerable to path traversal attack. This could be used by attacker to create a certificate file outside the temporary folder where they are stored during the time of validation. After certificate validation the file is deleted. In order to exploit the vulnerability an attacker could convince users to visit a web site with a specially crafted X.509 certificate. CVSS score of 5.0 ([AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2&vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N%29)).
- Virtual Keyboard functionality was vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This could be used by attackers with access to a host to read any PNG file on disk C. CVSS score of 1.5 ([AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2&vector=%28AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N%29)).
