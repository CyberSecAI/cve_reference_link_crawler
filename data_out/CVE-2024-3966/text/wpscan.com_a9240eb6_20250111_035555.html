## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Pray For Me <= 1.0.4 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could unauthenticated visitors to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks that trigger when an admin visits the Prayer Requests in the WP Admin

### Proof of Concept

1. Configure the plugin to add the first name and last name fields to the form: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=caruso\_prayer\_plugin\_settings
2. Add the `[prayer\_form]` shortcode to a post or page
3. As a unauthenticated user, fill out the form and enter `"><script>alert(1)</script>` in the "first name" and "last name" fields
4. As an admin, go to: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=caruso\_prayer\_plugin to see the XSS
