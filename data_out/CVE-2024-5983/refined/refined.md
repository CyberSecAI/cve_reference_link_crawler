Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation for the `pubid` parameter in the `bookPerPub.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows attackers to manipulate database queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize the `pubid` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System control:** In some cases, SQL injection can allow attackers to gain complete control of the system.
- **Service interruption:** SQL injection attacks can potentially lead to a denial of service by disrupting the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `pubid` parameter in the `bookPerPub.php` file.
- Attackers can craft malicious SQL queries and inject them into the vulnerable `pubid` parameter via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `bookPerPub.php` file.
- The attacker does not need any prior authorization to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using various SQL injection techniques such as time-based blind, boolean-based blind and error-based.
- The provided content includes a sample `sqlmap` command and screenshots of exploitation, showing the database enumeration.
- Remediation includes using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions and regular security audits.
