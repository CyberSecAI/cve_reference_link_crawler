- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient security configuration in IBM Robotic Process Automation for Cloud Pak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability stems from insufficient security configuration, which can lead to the creation of namespaces within a cluster.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker could potentially create namespaces within the cluster.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the IBM Robotic Process Automation for Cloud Pak itself, likely exploiting the insufficient security configurations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would require some level of access or interaction with the vulnerable IBM Robotic Process Automation for Cloud Pak system to exploit the vulnerability.
