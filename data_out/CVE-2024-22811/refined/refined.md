{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect Access Control",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control allowing an attacker to overwrite the Hostmot2 configuration cookie in the device memory."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) by disrupting the communication between the PathPilot controller and the CNC router.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The primary attack vector is the ability to overwrite the Hostmot2 configuration cookie in the device memory.",
       "After overwriting the cookie, the attacker initiates a restart of the machine and continuously injects the new cookie using an iterative injection technique."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to inject and overwrite the cookie in the device memory remotely."
  }
