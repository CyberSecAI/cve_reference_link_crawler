- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information in the FortiManager REST API JSON responses. Specifically, the admin password is sent in cleartext within the JSON response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker in a man-in-the-middle position can intercept the REST API JSON response and retrieve the admin password. This leads to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position to intercept network traffic. The attacker does not need prior authentication to retrieve the password.
