## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

This vulnerability is due to inadequate inspection of the Server Name Identification (SNI) header in the SSL/TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using data from the TLS client hello packet to communicate with a blocked external server. A successful exploit could be used to exfiltrate data from a protected network. The attacker must compromise a host on the network to exfiltrate the sensitive data.  The following Snort rule can be used to detect possible exploitation of this vulnerability: Snort SID 58062.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sni-data-exfil-mFgzXqLN>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected all open source Snort project releases earlier than Release 2.9.18. For more information about open source Snort, see the [Snort website](https://www.snort.org/).  At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were configured with the SSL/TLS decryption option and were also using web reputation or URL filtering features:    + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)   + 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) (except 4321 ISRs)   + Catalyst 8000V Edge Software   + Catalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms   + Catalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms   + Cloud Services Router 1000V Series (CSR 1000V)   + Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software, if the SSL/TLS decryption option is enabled   + Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv)   + Web Security Appliance (WSA), both physical and virtual devices, deployed in transparent mode For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Additional Considerations for FTD For an FTD device to be vulnerable, at least one SSL decryption policy must be enabled. As a prerequisite, an SSL decryption policy must be associated with a running access control policy.  **Determine Whether an SSL Decryption Policy Is Enabled on Cisco FTD Software**  There are two methods for determining whether an SSL decryption policy is enabled:  *Option 1: Use the CLI*  Use the **show ssl-policy-config** CLI command to verify whether an SSL decryption policy is enabled on a device. The following example shows the output of the **show ssl-policy-config** command on a device that does *not* have an SSL policy configured and is *not* vulnerable:  ```   > show ssl-policy-configSSL policy not yet applied.   ```  Any other output returned by the **show ssl-policy-config** command indicates that an SSL policy is configured and the device is vulnerable.  For more information about the **show ssl-policy-config** command, see the [Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense/s_8.html#wp8230585640).  *Option 2: Use the GUI*  To determine whether an SSL decryption policy is enabled on a device, check the appropriate policy:    + For devices managed by [Firepower Management Center (FMC)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/660/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v66/getting_started_with_ssl_policies.html#ID-2253-00000021): **Policies > Access Control > SSL**   + For devices managed by [Firepower Device Manager (FDM)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/660/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-660/fptd-fdm-ssl-decryption.html#task_A46EB67387764C209439122818AB7B43): **Policies > SSL Decryption**Additional Considerations for WSA For a WSA device to be vulnerable, the HTTPS Proxy feature must be enabled and at least one decryption policy must be configured. The HTTPS Proxy feature is disabled by default.  To determine whether the HTTPS Proxy feature is enabled for a WSA, administrators can log in to the web interface of the WSA and navigate to **Security Services > HTTPS Proxy**. The value in the **HTTPS Proxy** field indicates whether the feature is enabled or disabled. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  The following products either already inspect the SNI header, do not perform SSL/TLS inspection, or do not use any web reputation or URL filtering feature to detect malicious web domains that could be used as recipients for data exfiltration. Therefore, Cisco has confirmed that these products are not affected by this vulnerability:    + 1000 Series ISRs   + 4321 ISRs   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Catalyst 8500 Series Edge Platforms   + Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software   + Meraki security appliances, all models   + Open source Snort 3   + Umbrella  Details  * Using SNIcat or a similar tool, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending sensitive data to an arbitrary server, hiding it in the SNI header of the TLS client hello packet. This vulnerability does not provide a means for an attacker to obtain the data in the first place; the attacker must have already compromised a host in a protected network to use for collecting and exfiltrating the confidential information.  This advisory describes a filter bypass technique that could be used to circumvent protections that are based on web reputation filters, URL filtering, and threat detection. There is not a simple and deterministic way to identify every instance of data exfiltration because attackers may obfuscate the leaked data and use arbitrary, nonmalicious domains as recipients. However, Cisco is currently working to develop a solution that would extend the web reputation, URL filtering, or threat inspection features to the SNI header. This fix will mitigate this attack in cases where destination servers have a poor reputation or are already explicitly blocked by the administrators. This advisory will be updated once this solution becomes available.  In the meantime, to detect and mitigate any attack performed with the SNIcat tool, Cisco has released a Snort rule with the SID 58062. To ensure full protection, the action for the rule should be set to **Block**.  Workarounds  * For potential workarounds on a specific Cisco product, refer to the Description section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  The following products either already inspect the SNI header, do not perform SSL/TLS inspection, or do not use any web reputation or URL filtering feature to detect malicious web domains that could be used as recipients for data exfiltration. Therefore, Cisco has confirmed that these products are not affected by this vulnerability:    + 1000 Series ISRs   + 4321 ISRs   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Catalyst 8500 Series Edge Platforms   + Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software   + Meraki security appliances, all models   + Open source Snort 3   + Umbrella  Details  * Using SNIcat or a similar tool, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending sensitive data to an arbitrary server, hiding it in the SNI header of the TLS client hello packet.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## show serial-number

To display the printed circuit board (PCB) serial number, use the show serial-number  command. This command is not available on virtual devices.

show
serial-number

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use the show serial-number  command to view the printed circuit board's serial number. This information is also shown in show version system  and show running-config  output.

Use the show inventory  command to view the chassis serial number

## Examples

The following example shows how to display the serial number.
The number in this example has been changed to be invalid.

```

> show serial-number
XXX175078X5

```

## show service-policy

To display the service policy statistics, use the
show
service-policy  command.

show service-policy `[` global `|`interfaceintf`] [` cluster flow-mobility `|`inspectinspection `[` arguments`] |`police `|`priority `|`set connection `[` details`] |`sfr`|`shape `|`user-statistics`]`

show service-policy `[` global `|`interfaceintf`] [` flowprotocol `{` hostsrc\_host `|`src\_ipsrc\_mask`} [` eqsrc\_port`] {` hostdest\_host `|`dest\_ipdest\_mask`} [` eqdest\_port`] [` icmp\_number `|`icmp\_control\_message`]]`

## Syntax Description

| cluster flow-mobility | (Optional.) Shows status information on flow mobility in threat defense clusters. |
| --- | --- |
| dest\_ip dest\_mask | For the flow  keyword, the destination IP address and netmask of the traffic flow. |
| details | (Optional) For the set connection  keyword, displays per-client connection information, if a per-client connection limit is enabled. |
| eq dest\_port | (Optional) For the flow  keyword, equals the destination port for the flow. |
| eq src\_port | (Optional) For the flow  keyword, equals the source port for the flow. |
| flow protocol | (Optional) Shows policies that match a particular flow identified by the 5-tuple (protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port). You can use this command to check that your service policy configuration will provide the services you want for specific connections. |
| global | (Optional) Limits output to the global policy. |
| host dest\_host | For the flow  keyword, the host destination IP address of the traffic flow. |
| host src\_host | For the flow  keyword, the host source IP address of the traffic flow. |
| icmp\_control\_message | (Optional) For the flow  keyword when you specify ICMP as the protocol, specifies an ICMP control message of the traffic flow. |
| icmp\_number | (Optional) For the flow  keyword when you specify ICMP as the protocol, specifies the ICMP protocol number of the traffic flow. |
| inspect inspection [arguments] | (Optional) Shows detailed information about policies that include an inspect  command. Not all inspect  commands are supported for detailed output. To see all inspections, use the show service-policy inspect ?  command. The arguments available for each inspection vary; see the CLI help for more information. |
| interface intf | (Optional) Displays policies applied to the interface specified by the intf  argument, where intf  is the interface name. |
| police | (Optional) Shows detailed information about policies that include the police  command. |
| priority | (Optional) Shows detailed information about policies that include the priority  command. |
| set connection | (Optional) Shows detailed information about policies that include the set connection  command. |
| sfr | (Optional) Shows detailed information about policies for ASA FirePOWER modules. This keyword is not meaningful for threat defense. |
| shape | (Optional) Shows detailed information about policies that include the shape  command. |
| src\_ip src\_mask | For the flow  keyword, the source IP address and netmask used in the traffic flow. |
| user-statistics | (Optional) Shows detailed information about policies that include the user-statistics  command. This keyword is not meaningful for threat defense. |

### Command Default

If you do not specify any arguments, this command shows all
global and interface policies.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The number of embryonic connections displayed in the
show
service-policy  command output indicates the current number of
embryonic connections to an interface for traffic matching that defined for a
traffic class. The “embryonic-conn-max” field shows the maximum embryonic limit
configured for the traffic class. If the current embryonic connections
displayed equals or exceeds the maximum, TCP intercept is applied to new TCP
connections that match the traffic.

When you make service policy changes to the configuration, all
new connections use the new service policy. Existing connections continue to
use the policy that was configured at the time of the connection establishment.
show  command
output will not include data about the old connections. To ensure that all
connections use the new policy, you need to disconnect the current connections
so they can reconnect using the new policy. See the
clear conn  or
clear
local-host  commands.

You cannot directly configure service policies using management center or device manager. Some changes are made indirectly when you edit various connection settings or configure QoS policies. You can also adjust which default inspections are enabled using the configure inspection  command. If you use FlexConfig in management center to configure service policies, this command shows statistics related to your configuration.

| **Note** | ---   For an inspect icmp  and inspect icmp error  policies, the packet counts only include the echo request and reply packets.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following is sample output for the
show
service-policy  command.

```

For devices that have multiple CPU cores, there is a counter for
lock failure. The locking mechanism is used to protect shared data structures
and variables, because they can be used by multiple cores.When the core fails
to acquire a lock, it tries to get the lock again. The lock fail counter
increments for each failed attempt.

## show snmp-server

To display information about the SNMP servers configured on the
device, use the
show
snmp-server  command.

show snmp-server `{` engineID `|`group `|`host `|`statistics `|`user `[` username`]}`

## Syntax Description

| engineID | Displays the identification of the SNMP engine. |
| --- | --- |
| group | Displays the names of configured SNMP groups, the security model being used, the status of different views, and the storage type of each group. |
| host | Displays the names of configured SNMP hosts that belong to a host group, the interface being used, and the version of SNMP being used. |
| statistics | Displays SNMP server statistics. |
| user [username] | Displays information about the characteristics of SNMP users. You can optionally specify a username to limit the information to that user. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

An SNMP engine is a copy of SNMP that can reside on a local
device. The engine ID is a unique value that is assigned for each SNMP agent.
The engine ID is not configurable. The engine ID is 25 bytes long, and is used
to generate encrypted passwords. In a failover pair, the engine ID is
synchronized with the peer.

SNMP users and groups are used according to the View-based
Access Control Model (VACM) for SNMP. The SNMP group determines the security
model to be used. The SNMP user should match the security model of the SNMP
group. Each SNMP group name and security level pair must be unique.

| **Note** | ---   The statistics show information on input and output packets to the SNMP module. The fact that packets are output does not mean they reached the destination. Route problems, intervening firewalls, unplugged interfaces, and so forth can prevent the transmission of an output packet. If packets are not reaching the SNMP server, check for other issues using commands such as show asp drop  and show logging .   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following is sample output from the
show snmp-server
engineid  command:

```

> show snmp-server engineid
Local SNMP engineID: 80000009fe85f8fd882920834a3af7e4ca79a0a1220fe10685

```

The following is sample output from the
show snmp-server
group  command:

```

> show snmp-server group
groupname: public                           security model:v1
readview : <no readview specified>          writeview: <no writeview specified>
notifyview: <no readview specified>
row status: active

groupname: public                           security model:v2c
readview : <no readview specified>          writeview: <no writeview specified>
notifyview: *<no readview specified>
row status: active

groupname: privgroup                   security model:v3 priv
readview : def_read_view               writeview: <no writeview specified>
notifyview: def_notify_view
row status: active

```

The following is sample output from the
show snmp-server
host  command, which shows only the active hosts polling the
device:

```

> show snmp-server host
host ip = 10.10.10.3, interface = mgmt  poll community ***** version 2c
host ip = 10.10.10.6, interface = mgmt  poll community ***** version 2c

```

The following is sample output from the
show snmp-server
user  command:

```

> show snmp-server user authuser
User name: authuser
Engine ID: 00000009020000000C025808
storage-type: nonvolatile       active access-list: N/A
Rowstatus: active
Authentication Protocol: MD5
Privacy protocol: DES
Group name: VacmGroupName

```

The output provides the following information:

* The username, which is a string that identifies the name of the
  SNMP user.
* The engine ID, which is a string that identifies the copy of
  SNMP on the device.
* The storage-type, which indicates whether or not the settings
  have been set in volatile or temporary memory on the device, or in nonvolatile
  or persistent memory, in which settings remain after the device has been turned
  off and on again.
* The active access list, which is the standard IP access list
  associated with the SNMP user.
* The Rowstatus, which indicates whether or not it is active or
  inactive.
* The authentication protocol, which identifies which
  authentication protocol is being used. Options are MD5, SHA, or none. If
  authentication is not supported in your software image, this field does not
  appear.
* The privacy protocol, which indicates whether or not DES packet
  encryption is enabled. If privacy is not supported in your software image, this
  field does not appear.
* The group name, which indicates to which SNMP group the user
  belongs. SNMP groups are defined according to the View-based Access Control
  Model (VACM).

## show snort statistics

To display the number of packets that are matched for various
Snort verdicts when traffic is inspected by Snort, use the
show snort
statistics  command.

show snort
statistics

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.0.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to show Snort inspection results of your access
policy and intrusion rule configurations. This command is typically used when
debugging unexpected Snort inspection behavior. The statistics include the
following:

* Passed Packets—The number of packets sent to Snort from Lina.
* Blocked Packets—The number of packets blocked in Lina and not sent to Snort.
* Injected Packets—The number of packets Snort created and added to
  the traffic stream. For example, if you configure a block with reset action,
  Snort generates packets to reset the connection.
* Packets bypassed (Snort Down or Snort Busy)—If you configure the system to allow packets that require Snort inspection and
  Snort cannot perform the inspection, these counters are the number of packets that bypassed inspection when Snort was either
  down or too busy to handle the packets.

  | **Note** | ---   When flows are bypassed (passed without inspection) these busy and down counters increment until the bypassed session ends, which can occur even when Snort is no longer busy or down. For example, counters could increment for days if a persistent TCP connection that lasts for days sends a packet while Snort is busy or down and then continues after Snort resumes.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Fast-forwarded flows—The number of flows that were fast forwarded
  by policy, and thus not inspected.
* Blacklisted flows—The number of flows from policy configuration that were dropped by Snort.
* Start-of-flow events—The Lina process sends start-of-flow events
  to Snort when it fast paths a flow without sending it to Snort. These events
  help Snort keep track of the connections and report the connection events.
* End-of-flow events—The Lina process sends end-of-flow events to
  Snort when a fast path flow ends.
* Denied flow events—The Lina process sends denied flow events to
  Snort when it decides to drop a flow before sending it to Snort.
* Portscan Events—The number of portscan events that have been generated.
* Frames forwarded to Snort before drop—Valid for NGIPS interfaces only. This is the number of to-be-dropped packets forwarded
  to Snort. When the Lina process decides to drop the frame for some reason such as (Invalid TCP header length, Invalid UDP
  length or Invalid IP length), the frames are also sent to Snort for visibility.
* Inject packets dropped—The number of packets that Snort added to
  the traffic stream that were dropped.

  Inject packets dropped                                              0

```

In the following example, consider a case where the access control policy is configured to block and reset on all traffic.
Lina cannot handle the reset, so it promotes the packets to Snort to block and inject the reset to both client and server.

* Passed packets—shows eight packets passed from Lina to Snort.
* Injected packets—shows the two packets sent to client and server.
* Blacklisted flows—shows the flows Snort has told Lina to block.

  | **Note** | ---   There are no *blocked* packets in this example.   --- |

  Inject packets dropped                                              0

```

In the following example, consider a case where the access control policy has one rule that matches an FTP port and has a
block action, and another rule that matches an HTTP application and has an allow action.

* Passed packets—shows 60 HTTP packets because Lina sends packets for allow rules to Snort.
* Denied flow events—shows two data and control channel packets that Lina handled with an FTP port match.

  | **Note** | ---  There are no *blocked* packets in this example.  --- |

show
ssh-access-list  command. This access list allows SSH connections
to the management IP address from any IP address. Any user must supply a valid
username/password to actually complete the SSH connection.

```

> show ssh-access-list
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             state NEW tcp dpt:ssh
ACCEPT     tcp      anywhere             anywhere             state NEW tcp dpt:ssh

### Usage Guidelines

This command shows information about the current SSLv3 or
greater sessions, including the enabled cipher order, which ciphers are
disabled, SSL trustpoints being used, and whether certificate authentication is
enabled. These settings are for SSL connections on the data interfaces, not on
the management interface.

## Examples

The following is sample output from the
show ssl
command:

```

> show ssl
Accept connections using SSLv3 or greater and negotiate to TLSv1 or greater
Start connections using TLSv1 and negotiate to TLSv1 or greater
SSL DH Group: group2 (1024-bit modulus)
SSL ECDH Group: group19 (256-bit EC)

SSL trust-points:
  Self-signed (RSA 2048 bits RSA-SHA256) certificate available
  Self-signed (EC 256 bits ecdsa-with-SHA256) certificate available
Certificate authentication is not enabled

```

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use this command to view the SSL protocols configured for the management interface. These are the allowed protocols for HTTPS
connections, which are used to open the local manager, device manager. These protocols are not used for remote managers.

Use the
configure
ssl-protocol  command to configure these protocols.

## Examples

The following example shows how to view the SSL protocols
currently defined when using the local manager.

```

> show ssl-protocol
The supported ssl protocols are TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2

```

## show startup-config

To show the startup configuration or to show any errors when the
startup configuration loaded, use the
show
startup-config  command.

show startup-config `[` errors`]`

## Syntax Description

| errors | (Optional) Shows any errors that were generated when the startup configuration loaded. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The show startup-config  command displays the startup system configuration. You cannot directly configure these commands. Instead, they are configured
by the manager controlling the device, for example, management center or device manager.

However, this is a partial configuration. It shows what can be configured using ASA Software configuration commands only,
although some commands might be specific to threat
defense. These commands are ported to threat
defense. Thus, you should use the information in the startup configuration as a troubleshooting aid only. Use the device manager
as the main means to analyze the device configuration.

## Examples

The following is sample output from the
show startup-config
 command:

```

> show startup-config

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| show running-config all threat-detection | Shows the threat detection configuration, including the default rate settings if you did not configure them individually. |
| show threat-detection statistics host | Shows the host statistics. |
| show threat-detection statistics port | Shows the port statistics. |
| show threat-detection statistics protocol | Shows the protocol statistics. |
| show threat-detection statistics top | Shows the top 10 statistics. |

## show threat-detection rate

When you enable basic threat detection using the threat-detection basic-threat  command (using FlexConfig), you can view statistics using the show threat-detection rate  command.

show threat-detection rate `[` min-display-rateevents\_per\_second`] [` acl-drop `|` bad-packet-drop `|` conn-limit-drop `|` dos-drop `|` fw-drop `|` icmp-drop `|` inspect-drop `|` interface-drop `|` scanning-threat `|` syn-attack`]`

## Syntax Description

| acl-drop | (Optional) Shows the rate for dropped packets caused by denial by access lists. |
| --- | --- |
| bad-packet-drop | (Optional) Shows the rate for dropped packets caused by denial by a bad packet format (such as invalid-ip-header or invalid-tcp-hdr-length). |
| conn-limit-drop | (Optional) Shows the rate for dropped packets caused by the connection limits being exceeded (both system-wide resource limits, and limits set in the configuration). |
| dos-drop | (Optional) Shows the rate for dropped packets caused by a detected DoS attack (such as an invalid SPI, Stateful Firewall check failure). |
| fw-drop | (Optional) Shows the rate for dropped packets caused by basic firewall check failure. This option is a combined rate that includes all firewall-related packet drops in this command. It does not include non-firewall-related drops such as interface-drop, inspect-drop, and scanning-threat. |
| icmp-drop | (Optional) Shows the rate for dropped packets caused by denial by suspicious ICMP packets detected. |
| inspect-drop | (Optional) Shows the rate limit for dropped packets caused by packets failing application inspection. |
| interface-drop | (Optional) Shows the rate limit for dropped packets caused by an interface overload. |
| min-display-rate events\_per\_second | (Optional) Limits the display to statistics that exceed the minimum display rate in events per second, from 0 to 2147483647. |
| scanning-threat | (Optional) Shows the rate for dropped packets caused by a scanning attack detected. This option monitors scanning attacks; for example, the first TCP packet is not a SYN packet, or the TCP connection failed the 3-way handshake. Full scanning threat detection takes this scanning attack rate information and acts on it by classifying hosts as attackers and automatically shunning them, for example. |
| syn-attack | (Optional) Shows the rate for dropped packets caused by an incomplete session, such as TCP SYN attack or UDP session with no return data attack. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.3 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The display output shows the following:

* The average rate in events/sec over fixed time periods.
* The current burst rate in events/sec over the last completed burst interval, which is 1/30th of the average rate interval
  or 10 seconds, whichever is larger.
* The number of times the rates were exceeded.
* The total number of events over the fixed time periods.

The system computes the event counts 30 times over the average rate interval; in other words, the system checks the rate at
the end of each burst period, for a total of 30 completed burst intervals. The unfinished burst interval presently occurring
is not included in the average rate. For example, if the average rate interval is 10 minutes, then the burst interval is 10
seconds. If the last burst interval was from 3:00:00 to 3:00:10, and you use the show  command at 3:00:15, then the last 5 seconds are not included in the output.

The only exception to this rule is if the number of events in the unfinished burst interval already exceeds the number of
events in the oldest burst interval (#1 of 30) when calculating the total events. In that case, the system calculates the
total events as the last 59 complete intervals, plus the events so far in the unfinished burst interval. This exception lets
you monitor a large increase in events in real time.

## Examples

The following is sample output from the show threat-detection rate  command:

```

* The state of the service: enabled or disabled
* The service hold-down setting
* The service threshold setting
* Service action statistics

  + Failed—A failure occurrence when processing the reported occurrence.
  + Blocking—The reported occurrence is within the hold-down period and the threshold was met or exceeded. As a result, the service
    automatically installed a shun to block the mischievous peer.
  + Recording—The reported occurrence is outside of the hold-down period, or the threshold was met or exceeded. As a result, the
    service will record the occurrence.
  + Unsupported—The reported occurrence does not currently support automatic shunning.
  + Disabled—An occurrence was reported; but the service has been disabled.

## Examples

The following example shows that all services are enabled, and potential attackers are being tracked for the remote-access-authentication
service.

## show threat-detection statistics

If you enable threat statistics with the threat-detection statistics  command (using FlexConfig), view the statistics using the show threat-detection statistics  command. For clarity, the major keywords and options are shown separately in the following diagram.

show threat-detection statistics `[` min-display-rateeps`]` host `[` ip\_address `[` mask`]]`

show threat-detection statistics `[` min-display-rateeps`]` port `[` start\_port`[` -end\_port`]]`

## Syntax Description

| host [ip\_address [mask]] | Shows host statistics. You can optionally specify an IP address to show statistics for a particular host. You can include the subnet mask for the host.  Enable host statistics by configuring the threat-detection statistics host  command using FlexConfig. |
| --- | --- |
| min-display-rate eps | (Optional) Limits the display to statistics that exceed the minimum display rate in events per second, between 0 and 2147483647. |
| port [start\_port[-end\_port]] | Shows TCP/UDP port statistics. You can optionally specify a single port or a range of ports, between 0 and 65535.  Enable port statistics by configuring the threat-detection statistics port  command using FlexConfig. |
| protocol [number | name] | Shows protocol statistics. You can optionally specify the protocol by number or name. The number can be 0 - 255. The name can be one of the following: ah, eigrp, esp, gre, icmp, igmp, igrp, ip ipinip, ipsec, nos, ospf, pcp, pim, pptp, snp, tcp, udp.  Enable protocol statistics by configuring the threat-detection statistics protocol  command using FlexConfig. |
| top [access-list | host | port-protocol] [rate-1 | rate-2 | rate-3] | Shows the top 10 access rules, hosts, and ports/protocols, depending on options for which you enabled statistics. You can narrow the view using the following keywords:   * access-list  shows the top 10 ACEs that that match packets, including both permit and deny ACEs. If you enable basic threat detection   using the threat-detection basic-threat  command, you can track access list denies using the show threat-detection rate access-list  command. * host  shows the top 10 host statistics for each fixed time period. Due to the threat detection algorithm, an interface used for   a failover link or state link could appear as one of the top 10 hosts. This occurrence is more likely when you use one interface   for both the failover and state link. This is expected behavior, and you can ignore this IP address in the display. * port-protocol shows the top 10 combined statistics of TCP/UDP port and IP protocol types. TCP (protocol 6) and UDP (protocol 17) are not   included in the display for IP protocols. * rate-1 , rate-2 , rate-3  shows the statistics for the specified fixed rate period only, with 1 being the smallest, 3 the largest intervals available   in the display. For example, if the display shows statistics for the last 1 hour, 8 hours, and 24 hours, then rate 1 is 1   hour, rate 2 is 8 hours, and rate 3 is 24 hours. |
| top tcp-intercept [all] [detail] [long] | Shows TCP Intercept statistics. The display includes the top 10 protected servers under attack. You can include the following keywords:   * all  shows the history data of all the traced servers. * detail  shows history sampling data. * long  shows the statistical history in a long format, with the real and the translated IP addresses of the server. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.3 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Threat detection statistics show both allowed and dropped traffic rates.

The display output shows the following:

* The average rate in events/sec over fixed time periods.
* The current burst rate in events/sec over the last completed burst interval, which is 1/30th of the average rate interval
  or 10 seconds, whichever is larger.
* The number of times the rates were exceeded (for dropped traffic statistics only).
* The total number of events over the fixed time periods.

The system computes the event counts 30 times over the average rate interval; in other words, the system checks the rate at
the end of each burst period, for a total of 30 completed burst intervals. The unfinished burst interval presently occurring
is not included in the average rate. For example, if the average rate interval is 20 minutes, then the burst interval is 20
seconds. If the last burst interval was from 3:00:00 to 3:00:20, and you use the show  command at 3:00:25, then the last 5 seconds are not included in the output.

The only exception to this rule is if the number of events in the unfinished burst interval already exceeds the number of
events in the oldest burst interval (#1 of 30) when calculating the total events. In that case, the system calculates the
total events as the last 29 complete intervals, plus the events so far in the unfinished burst interval. This exception lets
you monitor a large increase in events in real time.

The following table explains the output for all commands with the exception of TCP Intercept views. See the TCP Intercept
example for an explanation of that output.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Top  Name, ID | For Top reports, the column shows the name or number of the access control entry, the IP address of the host, or the name/ID number of the port or protocol.  Entries are grouped by the fixed rate intervals and they are ranked within the time period, from [0] (highest count) to [9] (lowest count). You might not have enough statistics for all 10 positions, so fewer than 10 items might be shown for a given interval.  For host and port-protocol, the groupings are by sent and received bytes and packets per fixed interval. |
| Average(eps) | Shows the average rate in events/sec over each time period.  The system stores the count at the end of each burst period, for a total of 30 completed burst intervals. The unfinished burst interval presently occurring is not included in the average rate. For example, if the average rate interval is 20 minutes, then the burst interval is 20 seconds. If the last burst interval was from 3:00:00 to 3:00:20, and you use the show command at 3:00:25, then the last 5 seconds are not included in the output.  The only exception to this rule is if the number of events in the unfinished burst interval already exceeds the number of events in the oldest burst interval (#1 of 30) when calculating the total events. In that case, the system calculates the total events as the last 29 complete intervals, plus the events so far in the unfinished burst interval. This exception lets you monitor a large increase in events in real time. |
| Current(eps) | Shows the current burst rate in events/sec over the last completed burst interval, which is 1/30th of the average rate interval or 10 seconds, whichever is larger. For the example specified in the Average(eps) description, the current rate is the rate from 3:19:30 to 3:20:00 |
| Trigger | Shows the number of times the dropped packet rate limits were exceeded. For valid traffic identified in the sent and received bytes and packets rows, this value is always 0, because there are no rate limits to trigger for valid traffic. |
| Total events | Shows the total number of events over each rate interval. The unfinished burst interval presently occurring is not included in the total events. The only exception to this rule is if the number of events in the unfinished burst interval already exceeds the number of events in the oldest burst interval (#1 of 30) when calculating the total events. In that case, the system calculates the total events as the last 29 complete intervals, plus the events so far in the unfinished burst interval. This exception lets you monitor a large increase in events in real time. |
| Entry heading | The statistics are grouped by fixed interval under a heading. The heading can include the information explained in the following rows. In general, the entry heading starts with the following:   * Host, with the host IP address. * The port number/name. For example, 80/HTTP. * The protocol number or name. For example, ICMP. * For top reports, the fixed interval and statistics type. For access-list, the heading indicates this is for ACL hits. |
| tot-ses | Shows the total number of sessions for this host, port, or protocol since it was added to the database. |
| act-ses | Shows the total number of active sessions that the host, port, or protocol is currently involved in. |
| fw-drop  (Host only.) | Shows the number of firewall drops. Firewall drops is a combined rate that includes all firewall-related packet drops tracked in basic threat detection, including access list denials, bad packets, exceeded connection limits, DoS attack packets, suspicious ICMP packets, TCP SYN attack packets, and UDP session with no return data attack packets. It does not include non-firewall-related drops such as interface overload, packets failed at application inspection, and scanning attack detected. |
| insp-drop  (Host only.) | Shows the number of packets dropped because they failed application inspection. |
| null-ses  (Host only.) | Shows the number of null sessions, which are TCP SYN sessions that did not complete within the 30-second timeout, and UDP sessions that did not have any data sent by its server 3 seconds after the session starts. |
| bad-acc  (Host only.) | Shows the number of bad access attempts to host ports that are in a closed state. When a port is determined to be in a null session (see above), the port state of the host is set to HOST\_PORT\_CLOSE. Any client accessing the port of the host is immediately classified as a bad access without the need to wait for a timeout. |
| 20-min, 1-hour, 8-hour, and 24-hour | Shows statistics for these fixed rate intervals.   * Sent byte, sent pkts—Shows the number of successful bytes or packets sent from the host, port, or protocol. * Sent drop—Shows the number of packets sent from the host, port, or protocol that were dropped because they were part of a   scanning attack. * Recv byte, pkts—Shows the number of successful bytes or packets received by the host, port, or protocol. * Recv drop—Shows the number of packets received by the host, port, or protocol that were dropped because they were part of   a scanning attack. |

The following table explains the TCP Intercept output.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Monitoring window size | Shows the period of time over which the system samples data for statistics. The default is 30 minutes. You can change this setting using the threat-detection statistics tcp-intercept rate-interval  command using FlexConfig. The system samples data 30 times during this interval. |
| Sampling interval | Shows the interval between samples. This value is always the rate interval divided by 30. |
| Rank | Shows the ranking, 1 through 10, where 1 is the most attacked server, and 10 is the least attacked server. |
| Server IP:Port | Shows the server IP address and the port on which it is being attacked. |
| Interface | Shows the interface through which the server is being attacked. |
| Ave Rate | Shows the average rate of attack, in attacks per second over the sampling period. |
| Cur Rate | Shows the current attack rate, in attacks per second. |
| Total | Shows the total number of attacks. |
| Source IP | Shows the attacker IP address. |
| Last Attack Time | Shows when the last attack occurred. |

## show traffic

To display interface transmit and receive activity, use the
show traffic
command.

show traffic

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The
show traffic
command lists the number of packets and bytes moving through each interface
since the last
show traffic
command was entered or since the device came online. The number of seconds is
the duration the device has been online since the last reboot, unless the
clear traffic
command was entered since the last reboot. If this is the case, then the number
of seconds is the duration since that command was entered.

The statistics are first shown based on interface name. After
the named interfaces, statistics are shown based on the physical interface. The
interfaces can include hidden virtual interfaces that are used by the system
for internal communications.

## Examples

The following is an abbreviated sample output from the
show traffic
command, showing the statistics for a single interface. Each interface shows
the same statistics.

```

> show traffic
...
diagnostic:
        received (in 102.080 secs):
                2048 packets     204295 bytes

| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

You can use the
following options to filter and to sort the session display. The values you can
filter and sort on differ based on the session types you are listing.

| Filter/Sort Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| filter a-ipaddress IP\_address | Filters the output to display information for the specified assigned IP address or addresses only.  Use with: anyconnect , ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| sort a-ipaddress | Sorts the display by assigned IP addresses.  Use with: anyconnect , ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| filter a-ipversion {v4 | v6} | Filters the output to show only sessions assigned IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Use with: anyconnect , ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| filter encryption encryption\_algorithm | Filters the output to display information for sessions using the specified encryption algorithm only. Use ? to see the available methods.  Use with: anyconnect , l2l , ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| sort encryption | Sorts the output by the encryption algorithm used in the session.  Use with: anyconnect , l2l , ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| filter inactive | Filters by inactive sessions, which are sessions that have gone idle and have possibly lost connectivity (due to hibernation, mobile device disconnection, and so on). The number of inactive sessions increases when TCP keepalives are sent from the threat defense device without a response from the AnyConnect client. Each session is time stamped with the SSL tunnel drop time. If the session is actively passing traffic over the SSL tunnel, 00:00m:00s is displayed.  Use with: anyconnect   | **Note** | The threat defense device does not send TCP keepalives to some devices (such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod) to save battery life, so the failure detection cannot distinguish between a disconnect and a sleep. For this reason, the inactivity counter remains as 00:00:00 by design. | | --- | --- | |
| sort inactivity | Sorts by inactive sessions.  Use with: anyconnect |
| filter ipaddress IP\_address | Filters the output to display information for the specified inside IP address or addresses only.  Use with: l2l , ospfv3 |
| sort ipaddress | Sorts the display by inside IP addresses.  Use with: l2l , ospfv3 |
| filter ipversion {v4 | v6} | Filters the output to show only sessions originating from endpoints with IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Use with: l2l |
| filter name username | Filters the output to display sessions for the specified username.  Use with: anyconnect , l2l ,ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| sort name | Sorts the display by usernames in alphabetical order.  Use with: anyconnect , l2l ,ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| filter p-ipaddress IP\_address | Filters the output to display information for the specified public outside IP address or addresses only.  Use with: anyconnect , ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| sort p-ipaddress | Sorts the display by public outside IP addresses.  Use with: anyconnect , ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| filter p-ipversion {v4 | v6} | Filters the output to show only sessions originating from endpoints with public IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Use with: anyconnect , ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| filter protocol name | Filters the output to display information for sessions using the specified protocol only. Use ? to see the available protocols.  Use with: anyconnect , l2l , ra-ikev2-ipsec |
| sort protocol | Sorts the display by protocol.  Use with: anyconnect , l2l , ra-ikev2-ipsec |

| IKE Neg Mode | IKE (IPsec Phase 1) mode for exchanging key information and setting up SAs: Aggressive or Main. |
| IKE Sessions | Number of IKE (IPsec Phase 1) sessions; usually 1. These sessions establish the tunnel for IPsec traffic. |
| Index | Unique identifier for this record. |
| IP Addr | Private IP address assigned to the remote client for this session. This is also known as the “inner” or “virtual” IP address. It lets the client appear to be a host on the private network. |

| Protocol | Protocol the session is using. |
| Public IP | Publicly routable IP address assigned to the client. |
| Redirect URL | Following posture validation or clientless authentication, the ACS downloads the access policy for the session to the system. The Redirect URL is an optional part of the access policy payload. The system redirects all HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) requests for the remote host to the Redirect URL if it is present. If the access policy does not contain a Redirect URL, the threat defense device does not redirect HTTP and HTTPS requests from the remote host.  Redirect URLs remain in force until either the IPsec session ends or until posture revalidation, for which the ACS downloads a new access policy that can contain a different redirect URL or no redirect URL. |
| Rekey Int (T or D) | Lifetime of the IPsec (IKE) SA encryption keys. The T value is the lifetime in duration, the D value is in data transmitted. Only the T value is shown for remote access VPN. |

| Session Type | Type of session: LAN-to-LAN or Remote |
| SQ Int (T) | Status Query Time Interval. Time in seconds allowed between each successful posture validation or status query response and the next status query response. A status query is a request made by the system to the remote host to indicate whether the host has experienced any changes in posture since the last posture validation. |
| Status Query Time Interval | Time in seconds allowed between each successful posture validation or status query response and the next status query response. A status query is a request made by the system to the remote host to indicate whether the host has experienced any changes in posture since the last posture validation. |
| Time Until Next Revalidation | 0 if the last posture validation attempt was unsuccessful. Otherwise, the difference between the Revalidation Time Interval and the number of seconds since the last successful posture validation. |
| Tunnel Group | Name of the tunnel group referenced by this tunnel for attribute values. |

## show vrf

To show information about the virtual routers defined on a system, use the show vrf  command.

show vrf `[` counters `|` lock`]`

## Syntax Description

| counters | (Optional) Displays the maximum number of user-defined virtual routers allowed on this system, and the number of actual virtual routers configured. The maximum count doc not include the global virtual router: for example, if the maximum count is 4, the total limit is 5. |
| --- | --- |
| lock | (Optional) Displays VRF lock information. |

### Command Default

Without keywords, the command shows the current virtual routers and the interfaces assigned to each virtual router.

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.6 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Use the show vrf  command to view basic information about the virtual routers defined on the system if you enabled virtual routing and forwarding
(VRF). To view the routing tables for each virtual router, use the show route vrfname  command for the IPv4 routing table, and show ipv6 route vrfname  for the IPv6 routing table.

## Examples

The following example displays the virtual routers and the interfaces assigned to each router:

```

> show vrf

Name            VRF ID          Description             Interfaces
vrf1            1                               inside
                                                inside_2
vrf2            2                               inside_3
                                                inside_4

```

The following example shows the maximum number of virtual routers allowed on this system, and the current number of virtual
routers. Whether a virtual router is IPv4, IPv6, or both, depends on the IP addresses you assign to the interfaces within
each virtual router. Note that the maximum number refers to user-defined virtual routers; in this example, for a VMware system,
the total allowed limit is 15, one for the global virtual router, and 14 user defined routers.

```

> show vrf counters
Maximum number of VRFs supported: 14
Maximum number of IPv4 VRFs supported: 14
Maximum number of IPv6 VRFs supported: 14
Current number of VRFs: 2
Current number of VRFs in delete state: 0

```

The following example shows VRF lock information.

```

> show vrf lock

VRF Name: single_vf; VRF id = 0 (0x0)
VRF lock count: 1
VRF Name: vrf1; VRF id = 1 (0x1)
VRF lock count: 2
VRF Name: vrf2; VRF id = 2 (0x2)
VRF lock count: 2

```

## show xlate

To display information about NAT sessions (xlates or
translations), use the
show xlate
command.

show xlate `[` globalip1`[` -ip2`] [` netmaskmask`]] [` localip1`[` -ip2`] [` netmaskmask`]] [` gportport1`[` -port2`]] [` lportport1`[` -port2`]] [` interfaceif\_name`] [` typetype`]`

show xlate
count

## Syntax Description

| count | Displays the translation count. |
| --- | --- |
| global ip1[-ip2] | (Optional) Displays the active translations by mapped IP address or range of addresses. |
| gport port1[-port2] | Displays the active translations by the mapped port or range of ports. |
| interface if\_name | (Optional) Displays the active translations by interface. |
| local ip1[-ip2] | (Optional) Displays the active translations by real IP address or range of addresses. |
| lport port1[-port2] | Displays the active translations by real port or range of ports. |
| netmask mask | (Optional) Specifies the network mask to qualify the mapped or real IP addresses. |
| type type | (Optional) Displays the active translations by type. You can enter one or more of the following types:   * static * portmap * dynamic * twice-nat  (otherwise known as manual NAT)   When specifying more than one type, separate the types with a space. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The
show xlate
command displays the contents of the translation slots. The xlates can include
those generated for internal interfaces, which do not appear in the NAT rules
table in the device manager. These are required for internal processing.

When the VPN client configuration is enabled and the inside host
is sending out DNS requests, the
show xlate
command may list multiple xlates for a static translation.

In a clustering environment, up to three xlates might be
duplicated to different nodes in the cluster to handle a PAT session. One xlate
is created on the unit that owns the connection. One xlate is created on a
different unit to back up the PAT address. Finally, one xlate exists on the
director that replicates the flow. In the case where the backup and director is
the same unit, two instead of three xlates might be created.

## Examples

The following is sample output from the show xlate  command. The initial PAT xlates for nlp\_int\_tap relate to HTTPS access rules that allow device manager access to 192.168.1.1 rather than the management interface address. These are internal NAT xlates whose rules do not show
up in the NAT table in the device manager.

## show zone

To display traffic zone information, use the
show zone  command.

show zone`[` name`]`

## Syntax Description

| name | (Optional) The name of a traffic zone. |
| --- | --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Traffic zones are not exactly the same as security zones. Although
passive security zones are also automatically generated as traffic zones,
routed and switched security zones are not. Traffic zones are used for traffic
load balancing (using Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing), route redundancy,
and asymmetric routing across multiple interfaces.

To view the rest of the zone configuration, use the
show running-config zone  and
show running-config interface  commands.

## Examples

The following example displays the configured
traffic zones. In this example, the traffic zone is for passive interfaces. If
the zone was for Equal Cost Multi-Path routing, the zone type would be ecmp.
The interface configuration follows. The
zone-member  command configures the interface
as a member of the zone.

```

> show zone passive-security-zone
Zone: passive-security-zone passive
    Security-level: 0
    Zone member(s): 1

## shun

To block connections from an attacking host, use the
shun  command.
To disable a shun, use the
no  form of this
command.

## Syntax Description

| dest\_port | (Optional) Specifies the destination port of a current connection that you want to drop when you place the shun on the source IP address. |
| --- | --- |
| dest\_ip | (Optional) Specifies the destination address of a current connection that you want to drop when you place the shun on the source IP address. |
| interface if\_name | (Optional.) Specifies the interface on which to shun the source address. |
| protocol | (Optional) Specifies the IP protocol of a current connection that you want to drop when you place the shun on the source IP address, such as UDP or TCP. By default, the protocol is 0 (any protocol). |
| source\_ip | Specifies the address of the attacking host. If you only specify the source IP address, all future connections from this address are dropped; current connections remain in place. To drop a current connection and also place the shun, specify the additional parameters of the connection. Note that the shun remains in place for all future connections from the source IP address, regardless of destination parameters. |
| source\_port | (Optional) Specifies the source port of a current connection that you want to drop when you place the shun on the source IP address. |
| vlan vlan\_id | (Optional) Specifies the VLAN ID where the source host resides. |

### Command Default

The default protocol is 0 (any protocol).

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |
| 7.6 | The interface  keyword was added. |

### Usage Guidelines

The
shun  command
lets you block connections from an attacking host. All future connections from
the source IP address are dropped and logged until the blocking function is
removed manually. The blocking function of the
shun  command is
applied whether or not a connection with the specified host address is
currently active.

If you specify the destination address, source and destination
ports, and the protocol, then you drop the matching connection as well as
placing a shun on all future connections from the source IP address; all future
connections are shunned, not just those that match these specific connection
parameters.

If you do not specify a VLAN or an interface, the shun interface will be determined by a route look-up for the shunned IP.

You can only have one shun  command per source IP address per interface.

Because the shun  command is used to block attacks dynamically, it is not displayed in the device configuration.

Whenever an interface configuration is removed, all shuns that
are attached to that interface are also removed.

## Examples

The following example shows that the offending host (10.1.1.27) makes a connection with the victim (10.2.2.89) with TCP. The
connection in the device connection table reads as follows:

```

10.1.1.27, 555-> 10.2.2.89, 666 PROT TCP

```

Apply the
shun  command
using the following options:

```

> shun 10.1.1.27 10.2.2.89 555 666 tcp
Shun 10.1.1.27 added in context: single_vf
Shun 10.1.1.27 successful

```

The command deletes the specific current connection from the threat
defense device connection table and also prevents all future packets from 10.1.1.27 from going through the threat
defense device.

## system lockdown-sensor

To remove access to
expert mode and the Bash shell, use the
system
lockdown-sensor  command.

system lockdown-sensor

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.2.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

| **Caution** | ---   You cannot reverse this command. If you need to restore access to expert mode, you must contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center and get a hotfix.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The
expert  command
provides access to the Bash shell, which provides administrative users
extensive access to the system's operating environment. Security certification
regimes (such as Common Criteria (CC) or the Unified Capabilities Approved
Products List (UC APL)) impose requirements that limit the access and
information available to users of a system. Use the
system
lockdown-sensor  command to remove access to the
expert  command
to help meet these certification requirements.

| **Note** | ---   After using this command, the expert  command remains available in the current SSH session. You must log out and log back in to verify that the command has been removed and no longer works. Anyone else who logs in after you use the command will not be able to use expert mode either.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Examples

The following
example removes access to expert mode to comply with security requirements.

```

> system lockdown-sensor
This action will remove the 'expert' command from your system for all
future CLI sessions, rendering the bash shell inaccessible.

This cannot be reversed without a support call.
Continue and remove the 'expert' command?

Please enter 'YES' or 'NO': YES

```

## system support commands

Most **system support** commands are used for debugging and
troubleshooting with the assistance of the Cisco Technical Assistance Center. You
should use the **system support** commands under the direction of Cisco support,
with the exception of the commands documented in this guide, which are for general
use.

## system support ssl-client-hello- commands

These commands allow you to determine the behavior of Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 downgrade to TLS 1.2. Because managed
devices do not support TLS 1.3 encryption or decryption, TLS 1.3 sessions between a client and server can break, resulting
in errors like the following in the client web browser:

ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR

SEC\_ERROR\_BAD\_SIGNATURE

ERR\_SSL\_VERSION\_INTERFERENCE

Errors can occur when a client connects to a server and TLS inspection determines that the connection, which has been modified
to downgrade, matches a Do Not Decrypt SSL rule action.

We recommend you use these commands after consulting with Cisco TAC.

system support
ssl-client-hello-enabled
aggressive\_tls13\_downgrade
`{`
true
`|`
false
`}`

## Syntax Description

| true | Default. TLS 1.3 connections are downgraded whenever necessary to perform decryption. However, if data received after the ClientHello message causes the session to match a Do Not Decrypt rule, the session might fail. |
| --- | --- |
| false | TLS 1.3 connections are downgraded only when there is a reasonable certainty the session will not match a Do Not Decrypt rule. In some cases, TLS connections that need to be decrypted might not be downgraded. In those cases, traffic is not decrypted. The action specified in the SSL policy for Session not cached setting for its Undecryptable Action is taken instead. |

## system support diagnostic-cli

To enter the diagnsotic CLI, which includes additional show and
other troubleshooting commands, use the
system support
diagnostic-cli  command.

system support
diagnostic-cli

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The Diagnostic CLI contains additional show and other commands you can use to troubleshoot the system. The commands in the
Diagnostic CLI are from ASA Software. The regular threat
defense CLI contains many of the same commands, so you might not need the extra commands of the Diagnostic CLI.

When you enter the Diagnostic CLI, you are in a separate session from the regular threat
defense CLI.

The prompt changes to include the system hostname. There are two
modes, and the prompt indicates the mode you are in. For User EXEC mode, the
prompt is:

```

hostname>

```

For Privileged EXEC mode, also known as Enable mode, the prompt
is the following. You enter this mode using the enable command. Although you
are prompted for a password, simply press Enter, by default there is no
password required to enter this mode.

```

hostname#

```

Keep the following tips in mind when using the Diagnostic CLI:

* To exit the Diagnostic CLI and return to the regular CLI, press
  Ctrl+a, then d.
* Use the
  exit  command to leave Privileged EXEC mode.

  The commands available in each mode differ. Privileged EXEC mode
  includes significantly more commands than User EXEC mode. Use
  ?  to see the available commands. You can find
  usage information in the ASA Software command references:

  + Cisco ASA Series Command Reference, A - H Commands,
    <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa-command-reference/A-H/cmdref1.html>
  + Cisco ASA Series Command Reference, I - R Commands,

    Commands for the ASASM,
    <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa-command-reference/T-Z/cmdref4.html>
* The Diagnostic CLI can include commands that are not meaningful for threat
  defense. If you try a command that does not provide meaningful (or any) information, the related feature might not be configured
  or supported by threat
  defense.
* The Diagnostic CLI does not allow you to enter configuration
  mode. You cannot use the CLI to configure the device.
* When you detach from the Diagnostic CLI, the next time you enter
  it you are placed in the same mode you were in when you last detached.
* On the ASA 5506W-X, you can use the
  session
  wlan  command to open a connection to the wireless module, and use
  its CLI to configure the access point. You must be in Privileged EXEC mode.

## Examples

The following example shows how to enter the Diagnostic CLI and
Privileged EXEC mode. When you get the password prompt after entering the
enable  command,
simply press Enter. By default, there is no password to enter Privileged EXEC
mode.

```

> system support diagnostic-cli
Attaching to Diagnostic CLI ... Press 'Ctrl+a then d' to detach.
Type help or '?' for a list of available commands.

## system support ssl-hw- commands

These commands allow you to perform various operations on a feature referred to as *TLS/SSL hardware acceleration* in versions 6.2.3 and 6.3 and as *TLS crypto acceleration* in version 6.4. The available keywords depend on the threat
defense software version.

Supported devices and whether or not the feature is enabled or disabled by default also depend on software version. For this
information, refer to the management center Configuration Guide.

Syntax for versions 6.2.3 and 6.3:

system support `{` ssl-hw-status `|`  ssl-hw-supported-ciphers `|`  ssl-hw-offload enable `|`  ssl-hw-offload disable`}`

Syntax for version 6.4:

system support ssl-hw-supported-ciphers

## Syntax Description

| ssl-hw-status | Displays the current status of SSL hardware acceleration. The default state is:   * 6.2.3: disabled * 6.3 and 6.4: enabled |
| --- | --- |
| ssl-hw-supported-ciphers | Displays the list of ciphers supported by SSL hardware acceleration. This command is useful because SSL hardware acceleration doesn't support all of the ciphers supported by SSL software acceleration (in particular, decryption of SEED and Camellia ciphers is not supported). |
| ssl-hw-offload enable | Enables SSL hardware acceleration; you are prompted to reboot the device. |
| ssl-hw-offload disable | Disables SSL hardware acceleration; you are prompted to reboot the device. |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.4 | The feature name changed from TLS/SSL hardware acceleration to TLS crypto acceleration.  The following keywords have been removed:  ssl-hw-offload enable  ssl-hw-offload disable  ssl-hw-status |
| 6.3 | The feature is enabled by default. |
| 6.2.3 | This command was introduced. The feature is disabled by default. |

### Usage Guidelines

| **Note** | ---   Of the commands discussed in this section, only system support ssl-hw-offload-supported ciphers  applies to version 6.4.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Use these commands to display information about SSL hardware acceleration or to enable or disable the feature.

Enable SSL hardware acceleration to improve encryption and decryption performance.

Disable SSL hardware acceleration to use any of the features it does not support or if you encounter unexpected traffic interruptions
with an enabled SSL policy.

Features *not* supported by SSL hardware acceleration include the following:

* Managed devices where threat
  defense container instance is enabled.
* If the inspection engine is configured to preserve connections and the inspection engine fails unexpectedly, TLS/SSL traffic is dropped until the engine restarts.

  This behavior is controlled by the configure snort preserve-connection {enable | disable}  command.

Use the system support ssl-hw-status  command to display the current status.

Use the system support ssl-hw-supported-ciphers  command to display the list of ciphers supported by SSL hardware acceleration.

## Examples

Following is an example of viewing the current status of SSL hardware acceleration:

```

> system support ssl-hw-status
Hardware Offload configuration set to Disabled

```

Following is an example of enabling SSL hardware acceleration with prompting to reboot the device:

```

If you enable SSL hardware acceleration, you cannot:
    1.    Decrypt passive or inline tap traffic.
    2.    Preserve Do Not Decrypt connections when the inspection engine restarts.
Continue? (y/n) [n]: y

Enabling or disabling SSL hardware acceleration reboots the system. Continue? (y/n) [n]: y

SSL hardware acceleration will be enabled on system boot.

```

You are required to confirm all of the preceding before the device is rebooted.

Following is a
partial list of the ciphers supported by SSL hardware acceleration:

```

To view system log contents when working with the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to resolve a problem, use the
system support
view-files  command.

system support
view-files

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 6.1 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The
system support
view-files  command opens a system log. Use this command while
working with the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) so that they can help
you interpret the output and to select the appropriate log to view.

The command presents a menu for selecting a log. Use the
following commands to navigate the wizard:

* To change to a sub-directory, type in the name of the directory
  and press Enter.
* To select a file to view, enter
  s  at the prompt. You are then prompted for a file
  name. You must type the complete name, and capitalization matters. The file
  list shows you the size of the log, which you might consider before opening
  very large logs.
* Press the space bar when you see --More-- to see the next page
  of log entries; press Enter to see just the next log entry. When you reach the
  end of the log, you are taken to the main menu. The --More-- line shows you the
  size of the log and how much of it you have viewed.
  **Use Ctrl+C to
  close the log and exit the command if you do not want to page through the
  entire log.**
* Type
  b  to go up one level in the structure to the menu.

If you want to leave the log open so you can see new messages as
they are added, use the
tail-logs
command.

Debian Bug     : 1021276

Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in snort, a flexible Network
Intrusion Detection System, which could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or bypass filtering
technology on an affected device and ex-filtrate data from a compromised host.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.20-0+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your snort packages.

# Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide, Version 6.6

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. [Learn more](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/social-justice/inclusive-language-policy.html) about how Cisco is using Inclusive Language.

## SSL Policies Overview

An *SSL policy* determines how the system handles encrypted traffic on your network. You can configure one or more SSL policies, associate
an SSL policy with an access control policy, then deploy the access control policy to a managed device. When the device detects
a TCP handshake, the access control policy first handles and inspects the traffic. If it subsequently identifies a TLS/SSL-encrypted
session over the TCP connection, the SSL policy takes over, handling and decrypting the encrypted traffic.

| **Caution** | ---   Adding or removing an SSL policy restarts the Snort process when you deploy configuration changes, temporarily interrupting traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort® Restart Traffic Behavior](policy_management.html#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) for more information.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The simplest SSL policy, as shown in the following diagram, directs the device where it is deployed to handle encrypted traffic
with a single default action. You can set the default action to block decryptable traffic without further inspection, or to
inspect undecrypted decryptable traffic with access control. The system can then either allow or block the encrypted traffic.
If the device detects undecryptable traffic, it either blocks the traffic without further inspection or does not decrypt it,
inspecting it with access control.

![Diagram illustrating encrypted traffic evaluation in a simple SSL policy.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/300001-400000/370001-380000/372001-373000/372912.jpg)

A more complex SSL policy can handle different types of
undecryptable traffic with different actions, control traffic based on whether
a certificate authority (CA) issued or trusts the encryption certificate, and
use SSL rules to exert granular control over encrypted traffic logging and
handling. These rules can be simple or complex, matching and inspecting
encrypted traffic using multiple criteria.

| **Note** | ---   Because TLS and SSL are often used interchangeably, we use the expression *TLS/SSL* to indicate that either protocol is being discussed. The SSL protocol has been deprecated by the IETF in favor of the more secure TLS protocol, so you can usually interpret *TLS/SSL* as referring to TLS only.  The exception is SSL policies. Because the FMC configuration option is Policies > Access Control > SSL, we use the term *SSL policies* although these policies are used to define rules for TLS and SSL traffic.  For more information about SSL and TLS protocols, see a resource such as [SSL vs. TLS - What's the Difference?](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/ssl-vs-tls-difference/).   --- |

## SSL Policy Default Actions

The default action for an SSL policy determines how the system handles decryptable encrypted traffic that does not match any
non-monitor rule in the policy. When you deploy an SSL policy that does not contain any TLS/SSL rules, the default action determines how all decryptable traffic on your network is handled. Note that the system does not
perform any kind of inspection on encrypted traffic blocked by the default action.

Table 1. SSL Policy Default Actions

| Default Action | Effect on Encrypted Traffic |
| --- | --- |
| Block | Block the TLS/SSL session without further inspection. |
| Block with reset | Block the TLS/SSL session without further inspection and reset the TCP connection. Choose this option if traffic uses a connectionless protocol like UDP. In that case, the connectionless protocol tries to reestablish the connection until it is reset.  This action also displays a connection reset error in the browser so the user is informed that the connection is blocked. |
| Do not decrypt | Inspect the encrypted traffic with access control. |

## Default Handling Options for Undecryptable Traffic

Table 2. Undecryptable Traffic Types

| Type | Description | Default Action | Available Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compressed Session | The TLS/SSL session applies a data compression method. | Inherit default action | Do not decrypt  Block  Block with reset  Inherit default action |
| SSLv2 Session | The session is encrypted with SSL version 2.  Note that traffic is decryptable if the ClientHello message is SSL 2.0, and the remainder of the transmitted traffic is SSL 3.0. | Inherit default action | Do not decrypt  Block  Block with reset  Inherit default action |
| Unknown Cipher Suite | The system does not recognize the cipher suite. | Inherit default action | Do not decrypt  Block  Block with reset  Inherit default action |
| Unsupported Cipher Suite | The system does not support decryption based on the detected cipher suite. | Inherit default action | Do not decrypt  Block  Block with reset  Inherit default action |
| Session not cached | The TLS/SSL session has session reuse enabled, the client and server reestablished the session with the session identifier, and the system did not cache that session identifier. | Inherit default action | Do not decrypt  Block  Block with reset  Inherit default action |
| Handshake Errors | An error occurred during TLS/SSL handshake negotiation. | Inherit default action | Do not decrypt  Block  Block with reset  Inherit default action |
| Decryption Errors | An error occurred during traffic decryption. | Block | Block  Block with Reset |

When you first create an SSL policy, logging connections that
are handled by the default action is disabled by default. Because the logging
settings for the default action also apply to undecryptable traffic handling,
logging connections handled by the undecryptable traffic actions is disabled by
default.

Note that if your browser uses certificate pinning to verify a server certificate, you cannot decrypt this traffic by re-signing
the server certificate. For more information, see [TLS/SSL Rule Guidelines and Limitations](getting_started_with_ssl_rules.html#id_65029).

## Requirements and Prerequisites for SSL Policies

### Model Support

Any except NGIPSv.

### Supported Domains

Any

### User Roles

* Admin
* Access Admin
* Network Admin

## Manage SSL Policies

In the SSL policy editor, you can:

* Configure your policy.
* Add, edit, delete, enable, disable, and organize TLS/SSL rules.
* Add trusted CA certificates.
* Determine the handling for encrypted traffic the system cannot decrypt.
* Log traffic that is handled by the default action and undecryptable traffic actions.

In a multidomain deployment, the system displays policies created in the current domain, which you can edit. It also displays
policies created in ancestor domains, which you cannot edit. To view and edit policies created in a lower domain, switch to
that domain.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control > SSL. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Manage SSL policies:   * Associate—To associate an SSL policy with an access control policy, see [Associating Other Policies with Access Control](getting_started_with_access_control_policies.html#id_17609). * Compare—Click Compare Policies; see [Comparing Policies](policy_management.html#task_ABA1FE48DBBB44BC9FF40243FCC58BF6). * Copy—Click Copy  (copy icon). * Create—Click New Policy; see [Create Basic SSL Policies](#ID-2253-00000099). * Delete—Click Delete (delete icon). If the controls are dimmed, the configuration belongs to an ancestor domain, or you do not have permission to modify the   configuration. * Deploy—Choose Deploy > Deployment; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](policy_management.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B). * Edit—Click Edit (edit icon); see [Editing an SSL Policy](#ID-2253-0000018f). If View (View button) appears instead, the configuration belongs to an ancestor domain, or you do not have permission to modify the configuration. * Import/Export—See [About Configuration Import/Export](configuration_import_and_export.html#concept_D5CAA218397843A3A1E42CBD148A686B). * Report—Click Report (Report icon); see [Generating Current Policy Reports](policy_management.html#task_CCED983433824793AF09203FDAD1AF53). |

---

## Create Basic SSL Policies

To configure an SSL policy, you must give the policy a unique
name and specify a default action.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control > SSL. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click New Policy. |
| **Step 3** | Give the policy a unique Name and, optionally, a Description. |
| **Step 4** | Specify the Default Action; see [SSL Policy Default Actions](#ID-2253-00000065). |
| **Step 5** | Configure logging options for the default action as described in [Logging Connections with a Policy Default Action](connection_logging.html#ID-2174-000003ce). |
| **Step 6** | Click Save. |

---

What To Do Next

* Configure rules to add to your SSL policy; see [Creating and Modifying TLS/SSL Rules](getting_started_with_ssl_rules.html#ID-2254-000000b7).
* Set the default handling for undecryptable traffic; see [Set Default Handling for Undecryptable Traffic](#ID-2253-00000154).
* Configure logging options for default handling of undecryptable traffic; see [Logging Connections with a Policy Default Action](connection_logging.html#ID-2174-000003ce).
* Associate the SSL policy with an access control policy as described in [Associating Other Policies with Access Control](getting_started_with_access_control_policies.html#id_17609).
* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](policy_management.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

## Set Default Handling for Undecryptable Traffic

You can set undecryptable traffic actions at the SSL policy level to handle certain types of encrypted traffic the system
cannot decrypt or inspect. When you deploy an SSL policy that contains no TLS/SSL rules, the undecryptable traffic actions determine how all undecryptable encrypted traffic on your network is handled.

Depending on the type of undecryptable traffic, you can choose
to:

* Block the connection.
* Block the connection, then reset it. This option is preferrable for connectionless protocols like UDP, which keep trying to
  connect until the connection is blocked.
* Inspect the encrypted traffic with access control.
* Inherit the default action from the SSL policy.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the SSL policy editor, click Undecryptable Actions. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | For each field, choose either the SSL policy's default action or another action you want to take on the type of undecryptable traffic. See [Default Handling Options for Undecryptable Traffic](#ID-2253-000000d4) and [SSL Policy Default Actions](#ID-2253-00000065) for more information. |
| **Step 3** | Click Save to save the policy. |

---

### Example

For example, to block all SSLv2 traffic, set the options as follows:

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/446001-447000/446353.jpg)

### What to do next

* Configure default logging for connections handled by the undecryptable traffic actions; see [Logging Connections with a Policy Default Action](connection_logging.html#ID-2174-000003ce).
* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](policy_management.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

## Editing an SSL Policy

Only one person should edit a policy at a time, using a single browser window. If multiple users save the same policy, the
last saved changes are retained. For your convenience, the system displays information on who (if anyone) is currently editing
each policy. To protect the privacy of your session, a warning appears after 30 minutes of inactivity on the policy editor.
After 60 minutes, the system discards your changes.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control > SSL. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Edit (edit icon) next to the SSL policy you want to configure.  If View (View button) appears instead, the configuration belongs to an ancestor domain, or you do not have permission to modify the configuration. |
| **Step 3** | Configure the SSL policy:   * Describe—If you want to update your SSL policy description, click the Description field and enter the new description. * Log—If you want to log connections for undecryptable traffic handling and traffic that does not match SSL rules, see [Logging Connections with a Policy Default Action](connection_logging.html#ID-2174-000003ce). * Rename—If you want to rename your SSL policy, click the Name field and enter the new name. * Set the default action—If you want to configure how your SSL policy handles traffic that does not match SSL rules, see [SSL Policy Default Actions](#ID-2253-00000065). * Set the default action for undecryptable traffic—If you want to configure how your SSL policy handles undecryptable traffic,   see [Set Default Handling for Undecryptable Traffic](#ID-2253-00000154). * Trust—If you want to add trusted CA certificates to your SSL policy, see [Trusting External Certificate Authorities](decryption_tuning_using_ssl_rules.html#ID-2255-00000623). |
| **Step 4** | Edit the rules in your SSL policy:   * Add—If you want to add a rule, click Add Rule. * Copy—If you want to copy a rule, right-click a selected rule and choose Copy. * Cut—If you want to cut a rule, right-click a selected rule and choose Cut. * Delete—To delete a rule, click Delete (delete icon) next to the rule, then click OK. * Disable—To disable an enabled rule, right-click a selected rule, choose State, then choose Disable. * Display—To display the configuration page for a specific rule attribute, click the name or value in the column for the condition   on the row for the rule. For example, click the name or value in the Source Networks column to display the Networks page for the selected rule. See [Network Conditions](rule_management_common_characteristics.html#id_16163). * Edit—To edit a rule, click Edit (edit icon) next to the rule. * Enable—To enable a disabled rule, right-click a selected rule, choose State, then choose Enable. Disabled rules are dimmed and marked `(disabled)` beneath the rule name. * Paste—To paste a cut or copied rule, right-click a selected rule and choose Paste Above or Paste Below. |
| **Step 5** | Save or discard your configuration:   * To save your changes and continue editing, click Save. * To discard your changes, click   Cancel and, if   prompted, click   OK. |

---

### What to do next

* If the SSL policy is not already associated with an access control policy, associate it as described in [Associating Other Policies with Access Control](getting_started_with_access_control_policies.html#id_17609).
* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](policy_management.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

# SSL Decryption

Some protocols, such as HTTPS, use
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its follow-on version, Transport Layer Security
(TLS), to encrypt traffic for secure transmissions. Because the system cannot
inspect encrypted connections, you must decrypt them if you want to apply
access rules that consider higher-layer traffic characteristics to make access
decisions.

## About SSL Decryption

Normally, connections go through the access control policy to determine
if they are allowed or blocked. However, if you enable the SSL decryption
policy, encrypted connections are first sent through the SSL decryption policy
to determine if they should be decrypted or blocked. Any unblocked connections,
whether or not decrypted, then go through the access control policy for a final
allow/block decision.

| **Note** | ---   You must enable the SSL decryption policy in order to implement active authentication rules in the identity policy. If you enable SSL decryption to enable identity policies, but do not otherwise want to implement SSL decryption, select Do Not Decrypt for the default action and do not create additional SSL decryption rules. The identity policy automatically generates whatever rules it needs.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The following topics explain encrypted traffic flow management and
decryption in more detail.

### Why Implement SSL Decryption?

Encrypted traffic, such as HTTPS connections, cannot be inspected.

Many connections are legitimately encrypted, such as connections to banks and other financial institutions. Many web sites
use encryption to protect privacy or sensitive data. For example, your connection to the FDM is encrypted.

However, users can also hide undesirable traffic within encrypted
connections.

By implementing SSL decryption, you can decrypt connections, inspect
them to ensure they do not contain threats or other undesirable traffic, and
then re-encrypt them before allowing the connection to proceed. (The decrypted
traffic goes through your access control policy and matches rules based on
inspected characteristics of the decrypted connection, not on the encrypted
characteristics.) This balances your need to apply access control policies with
the user’s need to protect sensitive information.

You can also configure SSL decryption rules to block encrypted traffic
of types you know you do not want on your network.

Keep in mind that decrypting and then re-encrypting traffic adds a
processing load on the device, which will reduce overall system performance.

### Actions You Can Apply to Encrypted Traffic

When configuring SSL decryption rules, you can apply the actions
described in the following topics. These actions are also available for the
default action, which applies to any traffic that does not match an explicit
rule.

| **Note** | ---   Any traffic that passes through the SSL decryption policy must then pass through the access control policy. Except for traffic you drop in the SSL decryption policy, the ultimate allow or drop decision rests with the access control policy.   --- |

#### Decrypt Re-Sign

If you elect to
decrypt and re-sign traffic, the system acts as a man-in-the-middle.

For example, the user
types in https://www.cisco.com in a browser. The traffic reaches the
Firepower Threat Defense device, the device then negotiates with the user using the
CA certificate specified in the rule and builds an SSL tunnel between the user
and the
Firepower Threat Defense device. At the same time the device connects to
https://www.cisco.com and creates an SSL tunnel between the server and the
Firepower Threat Defense device.

Thus, the user sees
the CA certificate configured for the SSL decryption rule instead of the
certificate from www.cisco.com. The user must trust the certificate to complete
the connection. The
Firepower Threat Defense device then performs decryption/re-encryption in both
directions for traffic between the user and destination server.

![Decryption using certificate re-signing.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/420001-430000/420001-421000/420365.jpg)

| **Note** | ---   If the client does not trust the CA used to re-sign the server certificate, it warns the user that the certificate should not be trusted. To prevent this, import the CA certificate into the client trusted CA store. Alternatively, if your organization has a private PKI, you can issue an intermediate CA certificate signed by the root CA which is automatically trusted by all clients in the organization, then upload that CA certificate to the device.   --- |
| --- | --- |

If you configure a
rule with the Decrypt Re-Sign action, the rule matches traffic based on the
referenced internal CA certificate’s signature algorithm type, in addition to
any configured rule conditions. Because you can select a single re-sign
certificate for the SSL decryption policy, this can limit traffic matching for
resign rules.

For example, outgoing
traffic encrypted with an elliptic curve (EC) algorithm matches a Decrypt
Re-Sign rule only if the re-sign certificate is an EC-based CA certificate.
Similarly, traffic encrypted with an RSA algorithm matches Decrypt Re-Sign
rules only if the global re-sign certificate is RSA; outgoing traffic encrypted
with an EC algorithm does not match the rule, even if all other configured rule
conditions match.

#### Decrypt Known Key

If you own the
destination server, you can implement decryption with a known key. In this
case, when the user opens a connection to https://www.cisco.com, the user sees
the actual certificate for www.cisco.com, even though it is the
Firepower Threat Defense device that is presenting the certificate.

![Decryption using known keys.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/420001-430000/420001-421000/420366.jpg)

Your organization must
be the owner of the domain and certificate. For the example of cisco.com the
only possible way to have the end user see Cisco’s certificate would be if you
actually own the domain cisco.com (i.e. you are Cisco Systems) and have
ownership of the cisco.com certificate signed by a public CA. You can only
decrypt with known keys for sites that your organization owns.

The main purpose of
decrypting with a known key is to decrypt traffic heading to your HTTPS server
to protect your servers from external attacks. For inspecting client side
traffic to external HTTPS sites, you must use decrypt re-sign as you do not own
the servers.

| **Note** | ---   To use known key decryption, you must upload the server’s certificate and key as an internal identity certificate, and then add it to the list of known-key certificates in the SSL decryption policy settings. Then, you can write the rule for known-key decryption with the server’s address as the destination address. For information on adding the certificate to the SSL decryption policy, see [Configure Certificates for Known Key and Re-Sign Decryption](#task_2D9F7D21191B4B748745B9459F95A8FA).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Do Not Decrypt

If you elect to bypass
decryption for certain types of traffic, no processing is done on the traffic.
The encrypted traffic proceeds to the access control policy, where it is
allowed or dropped based on the access control rule it matches.

#### Block

You can simply block
encrypted traffic that matches an SSL decryption rule. Blocking in the SSL
decryption policy prevents the connection from reaching the access control
policy.

When you block an
HTTPS connection, the user does not see the system default block response page.
Instead, the user sees the browser’s default page for a secure connection
failure. The error message does not indicate the site was blocked due to
policy. Instead, errors might indicate that there are no common encryption
algorithms. It will not be obvious from this message that you blocked the
connection on purpose.

### Automatically Generated SSL Decryption Rules

Whether you enable the
SSL decryption policy, the system automatically generates Decrypt Re-sign rules
for each identity policy rule that implements active authentication. This is
required to enable active authentication for HTTPS connections.

When you enable the
SSL decryption policy, you see these rules under the Identity Policy Active
Authentication Rules heading. These rules are grouped at the top of the SSL
decryption policy. The rules are read only. You can change them only by
altering your identity policy.

### Handling Undecryptable Traffic

There are several characteristics that make a connection undecryptable. If a connection has any of the following characteristics,
the default action is applied to the connection regardless of any rule the connection would otherwise match. If you select
Block as your default action (rather than Do Not Decrypt), you might run into issues, including excessive drops of legitimate
traffic.

* Compressed
  session—Data compression was applied to the connection.
* SSLv2 session—The
  minimum supported SSL version is SSLv3.
* Unknown cipher
  suite—The system does not recognize the cipher suite for the connection.
* Unsupported cipher
  suite—The system does not support decryption based on the detected cipher
  suite.
* Session not
  cached—The SSL session has session reuse enabled, the client and server
  reestablished the session with the session identifier, and the system did not
  cache that session identifier.
* Handshake
  errors—An error occurred during the SSL handshake negotiation.
* Decryption
  errors—An error occurred during the decryption operation.
* Passive interface traffic—All traffic on passive interfaces (passive security zones) is undecryptable.

## License Requirements for SSL Decryption

You do not need a special license to use the SSL decryption policy.

However, you do need the URL license to create rules that use URL categories and reputations as match criteria. For information on configuring licenses,
see [Enabling or Disabling Optional Licenses](fptd-fdm-license.html#id_12247).

## Guidelines for SSL Decryption

Keep the following in
mind when configuring and monitoring SSL decryption policies:

* The SSL
  Decryption policy is bypassed for any connections that match access control
  rules set to trust or block if those rules:

  + Use security
    zone, network, geolocation, and port only as the traffic matching criteria.
  + Come before
    any other rules that require inspection, such as rules that match connections
    based on application or URL, or allow rules that apply intrusion or file
    inspection.
* When using URL category matching, note that there are cases where
  the login page for a site is in a different category than the site itself. For
  example, Gmail is in the “Web based email” category, whereas the login page is
  in the “Internet Portals” category. To get connections to these sites
  decrypted, you must include both categories in the rule.
* If a Vulnerability Database (VDB) update removes (deprecates) applications, you must make changes to any SSL decryption rules
  or application filters that use the application that was deleted. You cannot deploy changes until you fix these rules. In
  addition, you cannot install system software updates before fixing the issue. On the Application Filters object page, or the
  Application tab of the rule, these applications say “(Deprecated)” after the application name.
* You cannot disable the SSL decryption policy if you have any active authentication rules. To disable the SSL decryption policy,
  you must either disable the identity policy, or delete any identity rules that use active authentication.

## How to Implement and Maintain the SSL Decryption Policy

You can use SSL
decryption policies to turn encrypted traffic into plain text traffic, so that
you can then apply URL filtering, intrusion and malware control, and other
services that require deep packet inspection. If your policies allow the
traffic, the traffic is re-encrypted before it leaves the device.

The SSL decryption
policy applies to encrypted traffic only. No unencrypted connections are
evaluated against SSL decryption rules.

Unlike some other
security policies, you need to monitor and actively maintain the SSL decryption
policy, because certificates can expire or even be changed on destination
servers. Additionally, changes in client software might alter your ability to
decrypt certain connections, because the decrypt re-sign action is
indistinguishable from a man-in-the-middle attack.

The following
procedure explains the end-to-end process of implementing and maintaining the
SSL decryption policy.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | If you will implement Decrypt Re-sign rules, create the required internal CA certificate.  You must use an internal Certificate Authority (CA) certificate. You have the following options. Because users must trust the certificate, either upload a certificate client browsers are already configured to trust, or ensure that the certificate you upload is added to the browser trust stores.   * Create a   self-signed internal CA certificate, which is signed by the device itself. See   [Generating Self-Signed Internal and Internal CA Certificates](fptd-fdm-certificates.html#task_CB73ADE996FC43AF885ED0D4A5F83C97). * Upload an   internal CA certificate and key signed by an external trusted CA or by a CA   inside your organization. See   [Uploading Internal and Internal CA Certificates](fptd-fdm-certificates.html#task_5CD7D9D1E8B3434AA5C550EF5497EF81). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | If you will implement Decrypt Known Key rules, collect the certificate and key from each of the internal servers.  You can use Decrypt Known Key only with servers that you control, because you must obtain the certificate and key from the server. Upload these certificates and keys as internal certificates (not internal CA certificates). See [Uploading Internal and Internal CA Certificates](fptd-fdm-certificates.html#task_5CD7D9D1E8B3434AA5C550EF5497EF81). |
| **Step 3** | [Enable the SSL Decryption Policy](#task_760949762612428FB0D5C32F7788A825).  When you enable the policy, you also configure some basic settings. |
| **Step 4** | [Configure the Default SSL Decryption Action](#task_13ADCD983117415BA8628E354515D316).  If in doubt, select Do Not Decrypt as the default action. Your access control policy can still drop traffic that matches the default SSL decryption rule if appropriate. |
| **Step 5** | [Configure SSL Decryption Rules](#task_A273EF56A0F2407294086018A4228CBB).  Identify traffic to decrypt and the type of decryption to apply. |
| **Step 6** | If you configure known key decryption, edit the SSL decryption policy settings to include those certificates. See [Configure Certificates for Known Key and Re-Sign Decryption](#task_2D9F7D21191B4B748745B9459F95A8FA). |
| **Step 7** | If necessary, download the CA certificate used for Decrypt Re-sign rules and upload it to the browser on client workstations.  For information on downloading the certificate and distributing it to clients, see [Downloading the CA Certificate for Decrypt Re-Sign Rules](#task_57B8261C06EB4A87BC3075BD9EBAF378). |
| **Step 8** | Periodically, update re-sign and known key certificates.   * Re-sign certificate—Update this certificate before it expires. If you generate the certificate through the FDM, it is valid for 5 years. To check the validity period for a certificate, select Objects > Certificates, find the certificate in the list, and click the information icon (View or info icon button.) for it in the Actions column. The information dialog box shows the validity period and some other characteristics. You can   also upload a replacement certificate from this page. * Known-key   certificate—For any known-key decryption rules, you need to ensure that you   have uploaded the destination server’s current certificate and key. Whenever   the certificate and key changes on supported servers, you must also upload the   new certificate and key (as an internal certificate) and update the SSL   decryption settings to use the new certificate. |
| **Step 9** | Upload missing trusted CA certificates for external servers.  The system includes a wide range of trusted CA root and intermediate certificates issued by third parties. These are needed when negotiating the connection between the Firepower Threat Defense and the destination servers for decrypt re-sign rules.  Upload all certificates within a root CA’s chain of trust to the list of trusted CA certificates, including the root CA certificate and all intermediate CA certificates. Otherwise, it is more difficult to detect trusted certificates issued by intermediate CAs. Upload certificates on the Objects > Certificates page. See [Uploading Trusted CA Certificates](fptd-fdm-certificates.html#task_CCECD443E93B4AE4B34CBA91BDF23013). |

## Configuring SSL Decryption Policies

You can use SSL
decryption policies to turn encrypted traffic into plain text traffic, so that
you can then apply URL filtering, intrusion and malware control, and other
services that require deep packet inspection. If your policies allow the
traffic, the traffic is re-encrypted before it leaves the device.

The SSL decryption
policy applies to encrypted traffic only. No unencrypted connections are
evaluated against SSL decryption rules.

| **Note** | ---   VPN tunnels are decrypted before the SSL decryption policy is evaluated, so the policy never applies to the tunnel itself. However, any encrypted connections within the tunnel are subject to evaluation by the SSL decryption policy.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The following
procedure explains how to configure the SSL decryption policy. For an
explanation of the end-to-end process of creating and managing SSL decryption,
see
[How to Implement and Maintain the SSL Decryption Policy](#task_34CD66D6C4AD4EAE85092A0E28AB502E).

### Before you begin

The SSL decryption
rules table contains two sections:

* Identity Policy Active
  Authentication Rules—If you enable the identity policy and create
  rules that use active authentication, the system automatically creates the SSL
  decryption rules needed to make those policies work. These rules are always
  evaluated before the SSL decryption rules you create yourself. You can alter
  these rules only indirectly, by making changes to the identity policy.
* SSL Native
  Rules—These are rules that you have configured. You can add rules
  to this section only.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > SSL Decryption.  If you have not yet enabled the policy, click Enable SSL Decryption and configure policy settings, as described in [Enable the SSL Decryption Policy](#task_760949762612428FB0D5C32F7788A825). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Configure the default action for the policy.  The safest choice is Do Not Decrypt. For more information, see [Configure the Default SSL Decryption Action](#task_13ADCD983117415BA8628E354515D316). |
| **Step 3** | Manage the SSL decryption policy.  After you configure SSL decryption settings, this page lists all rules in order. Rules are matched against traffic from top to bottom with the first match determining the action to apply. You can do the following from this page:   * To disable   the policy, click the   SSL Decryption Policy toggle. You can re-enable it   by clicking   Enable SSL Decryption. * To edit policy settings, including the list of certificates used in the policy, click the SSL Decryption Settings button (Gear/Settings button.). You can also download the certificate used with decrypt re-sign rules so that you can distribute it to clients. See the   following topics:    + [Configure Certificates for Known Key and Re-Sign Decryption](#task_2D9F7D21191B4B748745B9459F95A8FA)   + [Downloading the CA Certificate for Decrypt Re-Sign Rules](#task_57B8261C06EB4A87BC3075BD9EBAF378) * To configure   rules:    + To     create a new rule, click the     + button. See     [Configure SSL Decryption Rules](#task_A273EF56A0F2407294086018A4228CBB).   + To edit     an existing rule, click the edit icon (edit icon)     for the rule (in the Actions column). You can also selectively edit a rule     property by clicking on the property in the table.   + To     delete a rule you no longer need, click the delete icon (delete icon)     for the rule (in the Actions column). * To move a   rule, edit it and select the new location from the   Order drop-down list. * If any rules have problems, for example, because of removed or changed URL categories, click the See Problem Rules link next to the search box to filter the table to show only those rules. Please edit and correct (or delete) these rules,   so that they will provide the service that you require. |

### Enable the SSL Decryption Policy

Before you can
configure SSL decryption rules, you must enable the policy and configure some
basic settings. The following procedure explains how to enable the policy
directly. You can also enable it when you enable identity policies. Identity
policies require that you enable the SSL decryption policy.

#### Before you begin

If you upgraded from
a release that did not have SSL decryption policies, but you had configured the
identity policy with active authentication rules, the SSL decryption policy is
already enabled. Ensure that you select the Decrypt Re-Sign certificate you
want to use, and optionally enable pre-defined rules.

#### Procedure

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > SSL Decryption. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Enable SSL Decryption to configure the policy settings.   * If this is   the first time you enabled the policy, the SSL Decryption Configuration dialog   box opens. Proceed with the next steps. * If you have   already configured the policy once and then disabled it, the policy is simply   enabled again with your previous settings and rules. You can click the   SSL Decryption Settings button (Gear/Settings button.) and configure settings as described in   [Configure Certificates for Known Key and Re-Sign Decryption](#task_2D9F7D21191B4B748745B9459F95A8FA). |
| **Step 3** | In Decrypt Re-Sign Certificate, select the internal CA certificate to use for rules that implement decryption with re-signed certificates.  You can use the pre-defined NGFW-Default-InternalCA certificate, or one that you created or uploaded. If the certificate does not yet exist, click Create Internal CA to create it.  If you have not already installed the certificate in client browsers, click the download button (Download button.) to obtain a copy. See the documentation for each browser for information on how to install the certificate. Also see [Downloading the CA Certificate for Decrypt Re-Sign Rules](#task_57B8261C06EB4A87BC3075BD9EBAF378). |
| **Step 4** | Select the initial SSL decryption rules.  The system includes the following pre-defined rule that you might find useful:   * Sensitive\_Data—This rule does not decrypt traffic   that matches web sites in the Financial Services or Health and Medicine URL   categories, which include banks, healthcare services, and so forth. You must   enable the URL license to implement this rule. |
| **Step 5** | Click Enable. |

---

### Configure the Default SSL Decryption Action

If an encrypted
connection does not match a specific SSL decryption rule, it is handled by the
default action for the SSL decryption policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > SSL Decryption. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click anywhere in the Default Action field. |
| **Step 3** | Select the action to apply to matching traffic.   * Do Not   Decrypt—Allow the encrypted connection. The access control policy   then evaluates the encrypted connection and drops or allows it based on access   control rules. * Block—Drop the   connection immediately. The connection is not passed on to the access control   policy. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional.) Configure logging for the default action.  You must enable logging for traffic that matches the default action to be included in dashboard data or Event Viewer. Select from these options:   * At End of   Connection—Generate an event at the conclusion of the connection.    + Send Connection Events To—If you want to send a copy     of the events to an external syslog server, select the server object that     defines the syslog server. If the required object does not already exist, click     Create New Syslog Server and create it. (To disable     logging to a syslog server, select     Any from the server list.)  Because     event storage on the device is limited, sending events to an external syslog     server can provide more long term storage and enhance your event analysis. * No Logging—Do not   generate any events. |
| **Step 5** | Click Save. |

---

### Configure SSL Decryption Rules

Use SSL decryption
rules to determine how to handle encrypted connections. Rules in the SSL
decryption policy are evaluated from top to bottom. The rule applied to traffic
is the first one where all the traffic criteria are matched.

You can create and
edit rules in the SSL Native Rules section only.

| **Note** | ---   Traffic for your VPN connections (both site-to-site and remote access) is decrypted before the SSL decryption policy evaluates connections. Thus, SSL decryption rules are never applied to VPN connections, and you do not need to consider VPN connections when creating these rules. However, any use of encrypted connections within a VPN tunnel are evaluated. For example, an HTTPS connection to an internal server through an RA VPN connection is evaluated by SSL decryption rules, even though the RA VPN tunnel itself is not (because it is decrypted already).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

If you are
creating a decrypt known-key rule, ensure that you upload the certificate and
key for the destination server (as an internal certificate) and also edit the
SSL decryption policy settings to use the certificate. Known-key rules
typically specify the destination server in the destination network criteria of
the rule. For more information, see
[Configure Certificates for Known Key and Re-Sign Decryption](#task_2D9F7D21191B4B748745B9459F95A8FA).

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > SSL Decryption.  If you have not configured any SSL decryption rules (other than the ones automatically generated for active authentication identity rules), you can add pre-defined rules by clicking Add Pre-Defined Rules. You are prompted to select the rules that you want. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do any of the following:   * To create a new rule, click   the   + button. * To edit an existing rule,   click the edit icon (edit icon)   for the rule.   To delete a rule you no longer need, click the delete icon (delete icon) for the rule. |
| **Step 3** | In Order, select where you want to insert the rule in the ordered list of rules.  You can insert rules into the SSL Native Rules section only. The Identity Policy Active Authentication Rules are automatically generated from your identity policy and are read-only.  Rules are applied on a first-match basis, so you must ensure that rules with highly specific traffic matching criteria appear above policies that have more general criteria that would otherwise apply to the matching traffic.  The default is to add the rule to the end of the list. If you want to change a rule's location later, edit this option. |
| **Step 4** | In Title, enter a name for the rule.  The name cannot contain spaces. You can use alphanumeric characters and these special characters: + . \_ - |
| **Step 5** | Select the action to apply to matching traffic.  For a detailed discussion of each option, see the following:   * [Decrypt Re-Sign](#concept_789AA81F890B4E2FBB7ECD375D29E2F9) * [Decrypt Known Key](#concept_E52D3CB8B10C435FB46C84F27C8D5061) * [Do Not Decrypt](#concept_961A65503CB84EED9E6A129E87E4539D) * [Block](#concept_85BEC0E9720C4470B8C6EA06216A0057) |
| **Step 6** | Define the traffic matching criteria using any combination of the following tabs:   * Source/Destination—The security zones (interfaces) through which the traffic passes, the IP addresses or the country or continent (geographical   location) for the IP address, or the TCP ports used in the traffic. The default is any zone, address, geographical location,   and TCP port. See [Source/Destination Criteria for SSL Decryption Rules](#concept_38D7F089EC654113A8D707474F90128B). * Application—The application, or a filter that defines applications by type, category, tag, risk, or business relevance. The default is   any encrypted application. See [Application Criteria for SSL Decryption Rules](#concept_3F963C2152AD4E8C8FF478C81121DA37). * URL—The URL   category of a web request. The default is that the URL category and reputation   are not considered for matching purposes. See   [URL Criteria for SSL Decryption Rules](#concept_74B6B146775F4362A8E733C2F972CBAC). * Users—The identity source, user or user group. Your identity policies determine whether user and group information is available for traffic matching.   You must configure identity policies to use this criteria. See [User Criteria for SSL Decryption Rules](#concept_6A327B6E35084F24AE39C9A37B7DBBA0). * Advanced—The   characteristics derived from the certificates used in the connection, such as   SSL/TLS version and certificate status. See   [Advanced Criteria for SSL Decryption Rules](#concept_594894DFBA064419977B9F2D8B8BE4FD).   To modify a condition, you click the + button within that condition, select the desired object or element, and click OK in the popup dialog box. If the criterion requires an object, you can click Create New Object if the object you require does not exist. Click the x for an object or element to remove it from the policy.  When adding conditions to SSL decryption rules, consider the following tips:   * You can   configure multiple conditions per rule. Traffic must match all the conditions   in the rule for the rule to apply to traffic. For example, you can use a single   rule to decrypt traffic based on URL category. * For each   condition in a rule, you can add up to 50 criteria. Traffic that matches any of   a condition's criteria satisfies the condition. For example, you can use a   single rule to apply application control for up to 50 applications or   application filters. Thus, there is an OR relationship among the items in a   single condition, but an AND relationship between condition types (for example,   between source/destination and application). * Matching URL category requires the URL filtering license. |
| **Step 7** | (Optional.) Configure logging for the rule.  You must enable logging for traffic that matches the rule to be included in dashboard data or Event Viewer. Select from these options:   * At End of   Connection—Generate an event at the conclusion of the connection.    + Send Connection Events To—If you want to send a copy     of the events to an external syslog server, select the server object that     defines the syslog server. If the required object does not already exist, click     Create New Syslog Server and create it. (To disable     logging to a syslog server, select Any from the server list.)  Because     event storage on the device is limited, sending events to an external syslog     server can provide more long term storage and enhance your event analysis. * No Logging—Do not   generate any events. |
| **Step 8** | Click OK. |

#### Source/Destination Criteria for SSL Decryption Rules

The Source/Destination
criteria of an SSL decryption rule define the security zones (interfaces)
through which the traffic passes, the IP addresses or the country or continent
(geographical location) for the IP address, or the TCP ports used in the
traffic. The default is any zone, address, geographical location, and any TCP
port. TCP is the only protocol matched to SSL decryption rules.

To modify a condition,
you click the
+ button within that condition, select the desired
object or element, and click
OK. If the criterion requires an object, you can
click
Create New
Object if the object you require does not
exist. Click the
x for an object or element to remove it from the
policy.

You can use the
following criteria to identify the source and destination to match in the rule.

Source Zones,
Destination Zones

The security
zone objects that define the interfaces through which the traffic passes. You
can define one, both, or neither criteria: any criteria not specified applies
to traffic on any interface.

* To match
  traffic leaving the device from an interface in the zone, add that zone to the
  Destination Zones.
* To match
  traffic entering the device from an interface in the zone, add that zone to the
  Source Zones.
* If you add
  both source and destination zone conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from one of the specified source zones and egress through one of the
  destination zones.

Use this
criteria when the rule should apply based on where the traffic enters or exits
the device. For example, if you want to ensure that all traffic going from
outside hosts to inside hosts gets decrypted, you would select your outside
zone as the
Source
Zones and your inside zone as the
Destination Zones.

Source Networks,
Destination Networks

The network
objects or geographical locations that define the network addresses or
locations of the traffic.

* To match
  traffic from an IP address or geographical location, configure the
  Source Networks.
* To match
  traffic to an IP address or geographical location, configure the
  Destination Networks.
* If you add
  both source and destination network conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from one of the specified IP addresses and be destined for one of the
  destination IP addresses.

When you add
this criteria, you select from the following tabs:

* Network—Select
  the network objects or groups that define the source or destination IP
  addresses for the traffic you want to control.

  | **Note** | ---   For Decrypt Known-Key rules, select an object with the IP address of the destination server that uses the certificate and key you uploaded.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Geolocation—Select the geographical location to
  control traffic based on its source or destination country or continent.
  Selecting a continent selects all countries within the continent. Besides
  selecting geographical location directly in the rule, you can also select a
  geolocation object that you created to define the location. Using geographical
  location, you could easily restrict access to a particular country without
  needing to know all of the potential IP addresses used there.

Source Ports,
Destination Ports/Protocols

The port objects
that define the protocols used in the traffic. You can specify TCP protocol and
ports only for SSL decryption rules.

* To match
  traffic from a TCP port, configure the
  Source Ports.
* To match
  traffic to a TCP port, configure the
  Destination Ports/Protocols.
* To match
  traffic both originating from specific TCP ports and destined for specific TCP
  ports, configure both. For example, you could target traffic from port TCP/80
  to port TCP/8080.

#### Application Criteria for SSL Decryption Rules

The Application
criteria of an SSL decryption rule defines the application used in an IP
connection, or a filter that defines applications by type, category, tag, risk,
or business relevance. The default is any application that has the SSL Protocol
tag. You cannot match SSL decryption rules to any non-encrypted application.

Although you can
specify individual applications in the rule, application filters simplify
policy creation and administration. For example, you could create an SSL
decryption rule that decrypts or blocks all high risk, low business relevance
applications. If a user attempts to use one of those applications, the session
is decrypted or blocked.

In addition, Cisco
frequently updates and adds additional application detectors via system and
vulnerability database (VDB) updates. Thus, a rule for high risk applications
can automatically apply to new applications without you having to update the
rule manually.

You can specify
applications and filters directly in the rule, or create application filter
objects that define those characteristics. The specifications are equivalent,
although using objects can make it easier to stay within the
50-items-per-criteria system limit if you are creating a complex rule.

To modify the
application and filters list, you click the
+ button within the condition, select the desired
applications or application filter objects, which are listed on separate tabs,
and click
OK in the popup dialog box. On either tab, you can
click
Advanced
Filter to select filter criteria or to help you search for specific
applications. Click the
x for an application, filter, or object to remove it
from the policy. Click the
Save As
Filter link to save the combined criteria that is not already an
object as a new application filter object.

For more information
about the application criteria and how to configure advanced filters and select
applications, see
[Configuring Application Filter Objects](fptd-fdm-objects.html#task_49CC5243743F4921AAF00CF6AB0264BE).

Consider the following
tips when using application criteria in SSL decryption rules.

* The system can
  identify unencrypted applications that become encrypted using StartTLS. This
  includes such applications as SMTPS, POPS, FTPS, TelnetS, and IMAPS. In
  addition, it can identify certain encrypted applications based on the Server
  Name Indication in the TLS ClientHello message, or the server certificate
  subject distinguished name value.
* The system can
  identify the application only after the server certificate exchange. If traffic
  exchanged during the SSL handshake matches all other conditions in an SSL rule
  containing an application condition but the identification is not complete, the
  SSL policy allows the packet to pass. This behavior allows the handshake to
  complete so that applications can be identified. After the system completes its
  identification, the system applies the SSL rule action to the remaining session
  traffic that matches its application condition.
* If a selected application was removed by a VDB update, “(Deprecated)” appears after the application name. You must remove
  these applications from the filter, or subsequent deployments and system software upgrades will be blocked.

#### URL Criteria for SSL Decryption Rules

The URL criteria of an
SSL decryption rule defines the category to which the URL in a web request
belongs. You can also specify the relative reputation of sites to decrypt,
block, or allow without decryption. The default is to not match connections
based on URL categories.

For example, you could block all encrypted Gambling sites, or decrypt untrusted Social Networking sites. If a user attempts to browse to any URL with that category and reputation combination, the session
is blocked or decrypted. For more information on URL category matching, see [Filtering URLs by Category and Reputation](fptd-fdm-access.html#concept_2190C5512921483CB9009A9FF5E3AE74).

Categories Tab

Click
+, select the desired categories, and click
OK. Click the
x for a category to remove it from the policy.

The default is
to apply the rule to all URLs in each selected category regardless of
reputation. To limit the rule based on reputation, click the down arrow for
each category, deselect the
Any checkbox, and then use the
Reputation slider to choose the reputation level.
The left of the reputation slider indicates sites that will be allowed without
decryption, the right side are sites that will be decrypted or blocked. How
reputation is used depends on the rule action:

* If the rule decrypts or blocks connections, selecting a reputation level also selects all reputations more severe than that
  level. For example, if you configure a rule to decrypt or block Questionable sites (level 2), it also automatically decrypts or blocks Untrusted (level 1) sites.
* If the rule allows connections without decryption (do not decrypt), selecting a reputation level also selects all reputations
  less severe than that level. For example, if you configure a rule to not decrypt Favorable sites (level 4), it also automatically does not decrypt Trusted (level 5) sites.

Check the Category for a URL

You can check on the category and reputation for a particular URL. Enter the URL in the URL to Check box and click Go. You will be taken to an external website to see the results. If you disagree with a categorization, click the Submit a URL Category Dispute link and let us know.

#### User Criteria for SSL Decryption Rules

The User criteria of
an SSL decryption rule defines the user or user group for an IP connection. You
must configure identity policies and the associated directory server to include
user or user group criteria in a rule.

Your identity policies
determine whether user identity is collected for a particular connection. If
identity is established, the IP address of the host is associated with the
identified user. Thus, traffic whose source IP address is mapped to a user is
considered to be from that user. IP packets themselves do not include user
identity information, so this IP-address-to-user mapping is the best
approximation available.

Because you can add a maximum of 50 users or groups to a rule, selecting groups usually makes more sense than selecting individual
users. For example, you could create a rule that decrypts traffic to the Engineering group that comes from the outside network,
and create a separate rule that does not decrypt outgoing traffic from that group. Then, to make the rule apply to new engineers,
you only need to add the engineer to the Engineering group in the directory server.

You an also select identity sources to apply to all users within that source. Thus, if you support multiple Active Directory
domains, you can provide differential decryption based on the domain.

To modify the users
list, you click the
+ button within the condition and select the desired
users or user groups using one of the following techniques. Click the
x for a user or group to remove it from the policy.

* Identity Sources—Select an identity source, such as an AD realm or the local user database, to apply the rule to all users obtained from the
  selected sources. If the realm you need does not yet exist, click Create New Identity Realm and create it now.
* Groups—Select the desired user groups. Groups are available only if you configure groups in the directory server. If you select
  a group, the rule applies to any member of the group, including subgroups. If you want to treat a sub-group differently, you
  need to create a separate access rule for the sub-group and place it above the rule for the parent group in the access control
  policy.
* Users—Select individual users. The user name is prefixed with the identity source, such as Realm\username.

  There are some built-in users under the Special-Identities-Realm:

  + Failed
    Authentication—The user was prompted to authenticate, but failed to
    enter a valid username/password pair within the maximum number of allowed
    attempts. Failure to authenticate does not itself prevent the user from
    accessing the network, but you can write an access rule to limit network access
    for these users.
  + Guest—Guest users
    are like Failed Authentication users, except that your identity rule is
    configured to call these users Guest. Guest users were prompted to authenticate
    and failed to do so within the maximum number of attempts.
  + No Authentication
    Required—The user was not prompted to authentication, because the
    user's connections matched identity rules that specified no authentication.
  + Unknown—There is
    no user mapping for the IP address, and there is no record of failed
    authentication yet. Typically, this means that no HTTP traffic has yet been
    seen from that address.

#### Advanced Criteria for SSL Decryption Rules

The Advanced traffic
matching criteria relate to characteristics derived from the certificates used
in the connection. You can configure any or all of the following options.

Certificate
Properties

Traffic matches
the certificate properties option of the rule if it matches any of the selected
properties. You can configure the following:

Certificate
Status

Whether
the certificate is
Valid or
Invalid. Select
Any (the default) if you do not care about
certificate status.

A
certificate is considered valid if all of the following conditions are met,
otherwise it is invalid:

* The
  policy trusts the CA that issued the certificate.
* The
  certificate’s signature can be properly validated against the certificate’s
  content.
* The
  issuer CA certificate is stored in the policy’s list of trusted CA
  certificates.
* None
  of the policy’s trusted CAs revoked the certificate.
* The
  current date is between the certificate Valid From and Valid To dates.

Self-Signed

Whether
the server certificate contains the same subject and issuer distinguished name.
Select one of the following:

* Self-Signing—The server
  certificate is self-signed.
* CA-Signing—The server certificate
  is signed by a Certificate Authority. That is, the issuer and subject are not
  the same.
* Any—Do not consider whether the
  certificate is self-signed as a match criteria.

Supported Version

The SSL/TLS version to match. The rule applies to traffic that uses the any of the selected
versions only. The default is all versions. Select from: SSL
3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS
1.1, TLS 1.2.

For example, if you wanted to permit TLSv1.2
connections only, you could create a block rule for the lower versions.

Traffic that
uses any version not listed, such as SSL v2.0, is handled by the default action
for the SSL decryption policy.

### Configure Certificates for Known Key and Re-Sign Decryption

If you implement
decryption, either by re-signing or using known keys, you need to identify the
certificates that the SSL decryption rules can use. Ensure that all
certificates are valid and unexpired.

Especially for
known-key decryption, you need to ensure that the system has the current
certificate and key for each destination server whose connections you are
decrypting. With a decrypt known key rule, you use the actual certificate and
key from the destination server for decryption. Thus, you must ensure that the
Firepower Threat Defense device has the current certificate and key at all times, or
decryption will be unsuccessful.

Upload a new
internal certificate and key whenever you change the certificate or key on the
destination server in a known key rule. Upload them as an internal certificate
(not an internal CA certificate). You can upload the certificate during the
following procedure, or go to the
Objects > Certificates page and upload it there.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > SSL Decryption. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the SSL Decryption Settings button (Gear/Settings button.). |
| **Step 3** | In Decrypt Re-Sign Certificate, select the internal CA certificate to use for rules that implement decryption with re-signed certificates.  You can use the pre-defined NGFW-Default-InternalCA certificate, or one that you created or uploaded. If the certificate does not yet exist, click Create Internal CA to create it.  If you have not already installed the certificate in client browsers, click the download button (Download button.) to obtain a copy. See the documentation for each browser for information on how to install the certificate. Also see [Downloading the CA Certificate for Decrypt Re-Sign Rules](#task_57B8261C06EB4A87BC3075BD9EBAF378). |
| **Step 4** | For each rule that decrypts using a known key, upload the internal certificate and key for the destination server.   1. Click    + under    Decrypt Known-Key Certificates. 2. Select the    internal identity certificate, or click    Create New Internal Certificate to upload it now. 3. Click    OK. |
| **Step 5** | Click Save. |

---

### Downloading the CA Certificate for Decrypt Re-Sign Rules

If you decide to
decrypt traffic, users must have the internal CA certificate that is used in
the encryption process defined as a Trusted Root Certificate Authority in their
applications that use TLS/SSL. Typically if you generate a certificate, or
sometimes even if you import one, the certificate is not already defined as
trusted in these applications. By default in most web browsers, when users send
HTTPS requests, they will see a warning message from the client application
informing them that there is a problem with the web site’s security
certificate. Usually, the error message says that the web site’s security
certificate was not issued by a trusted certificate authority or the web site
was certified by an unknown authority, but the warning might also suggest there
is a possible man-in-the-middle attack in progress. Some other client
applications do not show this warning message to users nor allow users to
accept the unrecognized certificate.

You have the
following options for providing users with the required certificate:

Inform users to
accept the root certificate

You can inform
the users in your organization what the new policies are at the company and
tell them to accept the root certificate supplied by the organization as a
trusted source. Users should accept the certificate and save it in the Trusted
Root Certificate Authority storage area so that they are not prompted again the
next time they access the site.

| **Note** | ---   The user needs to accept and trust the CA certificate that created the replacement certificate. If they instead simply trust the replacement server certificate, they will continue to see warnings for each different HTTPS site that they visit.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Add the root certificate to client devices

You can add the root certificate to all client devices on the network as a trusted root certificate authority. This way, the
client applications automatically accept transactions with the root certificate.

You can either
make the certificate available to users by E-mailing it or placing it on a
shared site, or you could incorporate the certificate into your corporate
workstation image and use your application update facilities to distribute it
automatically to users.

The following
procedure explains how to download the internal CA certificate and install it
on Windows clients.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Download the certificate from the FDM.   1. Select Policies > SSL Decryption. 2. Click the SSL Decryption Settings button (Gear/Settings button.). 3. Click the Download button (Download button.). 4. Select a download location, optionally change the file name (but not the extension), and click Save.  You can now cancel out of the SSL Decryption Settings dialog box. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Install the certificate in the Trusted Root Certificate Authority storage area in web browsers on client systems, or make it available for clients to install themselves.  The process differs depending on the operating system and type of browser. For example, you can use the following process for Internet Explorer and Chrome running on Windows. (For Firefox, install through the Tools > Options > Advanced page.)   1. From the    Start menu, select    Control    Panel > Internet Options. 2. Select the    Content tab. 3. Click the    Certificates button to open the Certificates dialog    box. 4. Select the    Trusted Root Certificate Authorities tab. 5. Click    Import, and follow the wizard to locate and select    the downloaded file (<uuid>\_internalCA.crt) and add it to the Trusted    Root Certificate Authorities store. 6. Click    Finish.  Messages    should indicate that the import was successful. You might see an intermediate    dialog box warning you that Windows could not validate the certificate if you    generated a self-signed certificate rather than obtaining one from a well-known    third-party Certificate Authority.  You can now    close out the Certificate and Internet Options dialog boxes. |

## Example: Blocking Older SSL/TLS Versions from the Network

Some organizations are required to prevent the use of older versions of SSL or TLS either by government regulation or company
policy. You can use the SSL Decryption policy to block traffic that uses an SSL/TLS version that you prohibit. Consider placing
this rule at the top of the SSL Decryption policy to ensure that you catch the prohibited traffic immediately.

The following example blocks all SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 connections.

### Before you begin

This procedure assumes you have already enabled the SSL Decryption policy as explained in [Enable the SSL Decryption Policy](#task_760949762612428FB0D5C32F7788A825).

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > SSL Decryption. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the + button to create a new rule. |
| **Step 3** | In Order, select 1 to place the rule at the top of the policy, or select the number most suitable for your network.  The default is to add the rule at the end of the policy. |
| **Step 4** | In Title, enter a name for the rule, for example, Block\_SSL3.0\_and\_TLS1.0. |
| **Step 5** | In Action, select Block. This will immediately drop any traffic that matches the rule. |
| **Step 6** | Leave the default values for all options on the following tabs: Source/Destination, Applications, URLs, Users. |
| **Step 7** | Click the Advanced tab and under Supported Versions, leave SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 selected, but uncheck TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2.  The policy should look like the following:  SSL decryption rule to block SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 connections. |
| **Step 8** | (Optional) Click the Logging tab and select At End of Connection if you want to dashboards and events to reflect blocked connections. You can also select an external syslog server if you are using one. |
| **Step 9** | Click OK.  You can now deploy the policy. Once deployed, any SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0 connection that goes through the system will be dropped.   | **Note** | SSL 2.0 connections are handled by the default action for the policy. If you want to ensure these are also dropped, change the default action to Block. | | --- | --- | |

### What to do next

If you implement this rule, we have the following recommendations:

* For any type of decrypt rule, leave the default settings on the Advanced tab, where all SSL/TLS options are selected. By applying
  to all versions, the handshake process is simplified. However, your initial block rule will still prevent SSL 3.0 and TLS
  1.0 connections.
* We normally recommend that you use Do Not Decrypt as the default action for the policy. However, because SSL 2.0 connections
  are always handled by the default action, you might want to use Block instead. However, if you want to apply Do Not Decrypt
  as the default action for all decryptable traffic, create a Do Not Decrypt rule at the end of the policy where you accept
  all default values for traffic matching criteria. This rule would match any supported TLS connection that does not match an
  earlier rule in the table, and act as the default for those TLS versions.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting SSL Decryption

The following topics explain how to
monitor and troubleshoot SSL decryption policies.

* [Monitoring SSL Decryption](#concept_F6B5C308790C43ABA150C8E3F937A71C)
* [Handling Web Sites Where Decrypt Re-sign Works for a Browser but not an App (SSL or Certificate Authority Pinning)](#concept_9CE017AD0A384BB581E3EFB7CBC76573)

### Monitoring SSL Decryption

You can view
information about decryption in the dashboards and events for traffic that
matches rules (or the default action) for which you enabled logging.

#### SSL Decryption Dashboard

To evaluate overall
decryption statistics, view the
Monitoring > SSL
Decryption dashboard. The dashboard shows the
following information:

* Percentage of
  encrypted versus plain text traffic.
* How much
  encrypted traffic is decrypted per SSL rules.

#### Events

In addition to the
dashboard, the event viewer (Monitoring > Events) includes SSL information for
encrypted traffic. Following are some tips in evaluating events:

* For connections
  that were dropped because they matched an SSL rule (or default action) that
  blocked matching traffic, the
  Action should be “Block,” and the
  Reason should indicate “SSL Block.”
* The
  SSL
  Actual Action field indicates the actual action that the system
  applied to the connection. This can differ from the
  SSL
  Expected Action, which indicates the action defined on the matching
  rule. For example, a connection might match a rule that applies decryption, but
  could not be decrypted for some reason.

### Handling Web Sites Where Decrypt Re-sign Works for a Browser but not an App (SSL or Certificate Authority Pinning)

Some apps for smart phones and other devices use a technique called SSL (or Certificate Authority) pinning. The SSL pinning
technique embeds the hash of the original server certificate inside the app itself. As a result, when the app receives the
resigned certificate from the Firepower Threat Defense device, the hash validation fails and the connection is aborted.

The primary symptom is that users cannot connect to the web site using
the site’s app, but they can connect using the web browser, even when using the
browser on the same device where the app fails. For example, users cannot use
the Facebook iOS or Android app, but they can point Safari or Chrome at
https://www.facebook.com and make a successful connection.

Because SSL pinning is specifically used to avoid man-in-the-middle
attacks, there is no workaround. You must choose between the following options:

* Support app users, in which case you cannot decrypt any traffic to
  the site. Create a Do Not Decrypt rule for the site’s application (on the
  Application tab for the SSL Decryption rule) and ensure that the rule comes
  before any Decrypt Re-sign rule that would apply to the connections.
* Force users to use browsers only. If you must decrypt traffic to the
  site, you will need to inform users that they cannot use the site’s app when
  connecting through your network, that they must use their browsers only.

#### More Details

If a site works in a browser but not in an app on the same device, you
are almost certainly looking at an instance of SSL pinning. However, if you
want to delve deeper, you can use connection events to identify SSL pinning in
addition to the browser test.

There are two ways an app might deal with hash validation failures:

* Group 1 apps, such as Facebook, send an SSL ALERT Message as soon
  as it receives the SH, CERT, SHD message from the server. The Alert is usually
  an “Unknown CA (48)” alert indicating SSL Pinning. A TCP Reset is sent
  following the Alert message. You should see the following symptoms in the event
  details:

  + SSL Flow Flags include ALERT\_SEEN.
  + SSL Flow Flags do not include APP\_DATA\_C2S or APP\_DATA\_S2C.
  + SSL Flow Messages typically are: CLIENT\_HELLO, SERVER\_HELLO,
    SERVER\_CERTIFICATE, SERVER\_KEY\_EXCHANGE, SERVER\_HELLO\_DONE.
* Group 2 apps, such as Dropbox, do not send any alerts. Instead
  they wait until the handshake is done and then send a TCP Reset. You should see
  the following symptoms in the event:

  + SSL Flow Flags do not include ALERT\_SEEN, APP\_DATA\_C2S, or
    APP\_DATA\_S2C.
  + SSL Flow Messages typically are: CLIENT\_HELLO, SERVER\_HELLO,
    SERVER\_CERTIFICATE, SERVER\_KEY\_EXCHANGE, SERVER\_HELLO\_DONE,
    CLIENT\_KEY\_EXCHANGE, CLIENT\_CHANGE\_CIPHER\_SPEC, CLIENT\_FINISHED,
    SERVER\_CHANGE\_CIPHER\_SPEC, SERVER\_FINISHED.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed).

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

"text": "A vulnerability in the web filtering features of multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass web reputation filters and threat detection mechanisms on an affected device and exfiltrate data from a compromised host to a blocked external server.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to inadequate inspection of the Server Name Identification (SNI) header in the SSL/TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using data from the TLS client hello packet to communicate with a blocked external server. A successful exploit could be used to exfiltrate data from a protected network. The attacker must compromise a host on the network to exfiltrate the sensitive data.\r\n\r\nThe following Snort rule can be used to detect possible exploitation of this vulnerability: Snort SID 58062.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n"

"text": "At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected all open source Snort project releases earlier than Release 2.9.18. For more information about open source Snort, see the Snort website [\"https://www.snort.org/\"].\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were configured with the SSL/TLS decryption option and were also using web reputation or URL filtering features:\r\n 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs) 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) (except 4321 ISRs) Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Catalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms Catalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms Cloud Services Router 1000V Series (CSR 1000V) Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software, if the SSL/TLS decryption option is enabled Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv) Web Security Appliance (WSA), both physical and virtual devices, deployed in transparent mode\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n Additional Considerations for FTD\r\nFor an FTD device to be vulnerable, at least one SSL decryption policy must be enabled. As a prerequisite, an SSL decryption policy must be associated with a running access control policy.\r\n\r\nDetermine Whether an SSL Decryption Policy Is Enabled on Cisco FTD Software\r\n\r\nThere are two methods for determining whether an SSL decryption policy is enabled:\r\n\r\nOption 1: Use the CLI\r\n\r\nUse the show ssl-policy-config CLI command to verify whether an SSL decryption policy is enabled on a device. The following example shows the output of the show ssl-policy-config command on a device that does not have an SSL policy configured and is not vulnerable:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show ssl-policy-config\r\nSSL policy not yet applied.\r\n\r\nAny other output returned by the show ssl-policy-config command indicates that an SSL policy is configured and the device is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the show ssl-policy-config command, see the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Command Reference [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command\_ref/b\_Command\_Reference\_for\_Firepower\_Threat\_Defense/s\_8.html#wp8230585640\"].\r\n\r\nOption 2: Use the GUI\r\n\r\nTo determine whether an SSL decryption policy is enabled on a device, check the appropriate policy:\r\n\r\nFor devices managed by Firepower Management Center (FMC) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/660/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v66/getting\_started\_with\_ssl\_policies.html#ID-2253-00000021\"]:\r\nPolicies > Access Control > SSL\r\nFor devices managed by Firepower Device Manager (FDM) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/660/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-660/fptd-fdm-ssl-decryption.html#task\_A46EB67387764C209439122818AB7B43\"]:\r\nPolicies > SSL Decryption\r\n Additional Considerations for WSA\r\nFor a WSA device to be vulnerable, the HTTPS Proxy feature must be enabled and at least one decryption policy must be configured. The HTTPS Proxy feature is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the HTTPS Proxy feature is enabled for a WSA, administrators can log in to the web interface of the WSA and navigate to Security Services > HTTPS Proxy.

"text": "Using SNIcat or a similar tool, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending sensitive data to an arbitrary server, hiding it in the SNI header of the TLS client hello packet. This vulnerability does not provide a means for an attacker to obtain the data in the first place; the attacker must have already compromised a host in a protected network to use for collecting and exfiltrating the confidential information.\r\n\r\nThis advisory describes a filter bypass technique that could be used to circumvent protections that are based on web reputation filters, URL filtering, and threat detection. There is not a simple and deterministic way to identify every instance of data exfiltration because attackers may obfuscate the leaked data and use arbitrary, nonmalicious domains as recipients. However, Cisco is currently working to develop a solution that would extend the web reputation, URL filtering, or threat inspection features to the SNI header. This fix will mitigate this attack in cases where destination servers have a poor reputation or are already explicitly blocked by the administrators. This advisory will be updated once this solution becomes available.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, to detect and mitigate any attack performed with the SNIcat tool, Cisco has released a Snort rule with the SID 58062. To ensure full protection, the action for the rule should be set to Block."
