 - Root cause of vulnerability: Inadequate inspection of the Server Name Identification (SNI) header in the SSL/TLS handshake.
 - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Web filtering features of multiple Cisco products do not properly inspect the SNI header in the SSL/TLS handshake.
 - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can bypass web reputation filters and threat detection mechanisms, and exfiltrate data from a compromised host to a blocked external server.
 - Attack vectors: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability using data from the TLS client hello packet to communicate with a blocked external server. The attacker must compromise a host on the network to exfiltrate the sensitive data.
 - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system and needs to compromise a host on the protected network to exfiltrate the data.
 
  
 Additional details:
 - The advisory mentions the use of SNIcat or similar tools for exploiting this vulnerability.
 - A Snort rule (SID 58062) is provided to detect exploitation attempts.
 - The vulnerability affects various Cisco products including 3000 Series ISAs, 4000 Series ISRs (except 4321), Catalyst 8000V Edge Software, Catalyst 8200/8300 Series Edge Platforms, CSR 1000V, FTD Software (if SSL/TLS decryption is enabled), ISRv, and WSA in transparent mode.
 - It also specifies how to determine if an FTD or WSA device is vulnerable.
