                 CVE-2021-1236 CVE-2021-1494 CVE-2021-1495 CVE-2021-34749

Debian Bug     : 1021276

Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in snort, a flexible Network
Intrusion Detection System, which could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or bypass filtering
technology on an affected device and ex-filtrate data from a compromised host.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.9.20-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your snort packages.

For the detailed security status of snort please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/snort>
