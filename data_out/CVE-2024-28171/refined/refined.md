The provided content is related to CVE-2024-28171.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, which is a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is a path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22). This allows an attacker to write outside the intended directory. If a file name is specified that already exists on the file system, the original file will be overwritten.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the system. This can result in a loss of integrity and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote (network-based). An attacker with low privileges can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs low privileges on the system and network access to exploit the vulnerability. User interaction is not required.
