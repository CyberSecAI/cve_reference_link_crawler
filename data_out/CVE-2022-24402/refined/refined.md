Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-24402:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The TEA1 algorithm, used for Air Interface Encryption (AIE) in the TETRA standard, has a backdoor that reduces the effective key size from 80 bits to a size that can be easily brute-forced.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Backdoor in TEA1 cipher:** An intentional weakening in the TEA1 algorithm reduces its effective key size.
- **Weakened Cryptography:** The effective key size is significantly reduced, making the cipher vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- **Proprietary Algorithm:**  The secrecy surrounding the algorithm contributed to the lack of scrutiny, and therefore, its weakness.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Loss of confidentiality:** Attackers can decrypt TEA1-encrypted communications.
- **Loss of authenticity:** Attackers can potentially manipulate TEA1-encrypted data.
- **Compromise of sensitive information:**  Interception of radio communications from law enforcement, military, and private security services.
- **Manipulation of industrial equipment**: Potential for injecting malicious traffic in industrial control systems using TETRA.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Passive attack:** Attackers can passively intercept and decrypt communications.
- **Active attack:** Attackers can actively inject malicious messages after decrypting the traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to intercept TETRA communications:** The attacker needs to be able to capture radio transmissions.
- **Consumer grade hardware:** The brute-force attack can be performed using readily available consumer hardware within minutes.
- **Knowledge of the TEA1 algorithm**: The attacker needs to know how the algorithm functions to brute-force the key.

**Additional details:**
- The TEA1 algorithm was intentionally weakened, not as a result of a flawed design.
- The vulnerability allows for the full break of the cipher.
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can be undetectable.
- This vulnerability is of particular concern for critical infrastructure operators using TEA1 encryption.
- Mitigation requires a switch to End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) or to consider TEA1 traffic as equivalent to cleartext.
