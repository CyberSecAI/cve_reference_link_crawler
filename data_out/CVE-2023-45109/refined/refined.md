- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force a higher-privileged user to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is achieved via CSRF.
