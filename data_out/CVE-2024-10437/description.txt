The WPC Smart Messages for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized Smar Message activation/deactivation due to a missing capability check on the ajax_enable function in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to activate or deactivate smart messages.
