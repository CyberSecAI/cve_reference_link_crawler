```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mIPC firmware has insufficient input sanitization when setting a timezone, leading to command injection. Specifically, the `choose_utc_timezone` function copies the timezone string to a stack buffer without size validation and then uses sprintf to construct a shell command, allowing injection via the timezone string.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow via strcpy in the `choose_utc_timezone` function when copying the timezone string to a stack buffer.",
    "Command injection vulnerability in the `choose_utc_timezone` function by passing a crafted string containing shell commands which is then executed via system call."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the mIPC firmware. The attacker can gain full shell access to the device, allowing them to perform any action they wish.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by sending a crafted timezone string via the mobile application's time setting functionality. The vulnerable function is invoked when setting the timezone, causing the command injection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated in the mobile application to interface with the camera running the vulnerable mIPC firmware. They must be able to set a timezone on the camera via the mobile app. They also need to host a payload on an external server."
