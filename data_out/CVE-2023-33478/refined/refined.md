Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter from the HTTP GET request is used directly in the `WHERE` clause of a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting malicious input within the `id` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL code, bypassing intended application logic and accessing sensitive database information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data, such as database schema information, user credentials, and potentially other confidential information stored in the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Through the SQL injection, an attacker could potentially gain access to other parts of the application, or even the underlying system in some circumstances.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is the `id` parameter in an HTTP GET request to the `/medicines/stocks.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
*   **Knowledge of Application Structure (Optional):** While not strictly necessary for a blind SQL injection attack, some knowledge of the application structure and database schema would enable a more targeted and effective attack. The provided exploit, however, shows it is fairly straightforward for the attacker to get this information.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `medicines/stocks.php` at line 51:
    ```php
    $sql=mysqli_query($con, "select * from p_stock where branch='$id' order by code asc limit   20000")or die(mysqli_error());
    ```
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Extract the database names.
    *   Extract user credentials (userid and passkey) from the `p_staff_dir` table.
*   The PoC also uses a delimiter to split the output and uses `JSON_ARRAYAGG` and `CONCAT_WS` to construct the query output.
