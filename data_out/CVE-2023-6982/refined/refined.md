Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the "Display custom fields in the frontend â€“ Post and User Profile Fields" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin's shortcode `[vg_display_data]` and the way it handles postmeta are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. User-provided data is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and stored in the database. These scripts are then executed when a user views the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of the affected website.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:** Attackers could potentially hijack user sessions, steal cookies, or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker might be able to modify the content of pages, deface the website or perform other malicious actions on the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's shortcode `[vg_display_data]`.
*   **Postmeta Manipulation:**  The vulnerability occurs because the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied attributes and data when processing postmeta.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level permissions or higher on the WordPress site. This means that someone with the ability to create/edit posts can inject malicious code.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected versions:** All versions of the plugin up to and including 1.2.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Version:** Version 1.3.0 addresses this vulnerability.
*  **Mitigation:** The plugin now requires whitelisting of keys that are used in the shortcode, which can be done through the plugin's settings page.
*   **Sanitization:** The "sanitization" parameter has been removed, and now all outputs are sanitized with `wp_kses_post` always.
*   **Removed parameters:** The `wp_filter` parameter was removed. Now the plugin has specific parameters like `wpautop` and `do_shortcodes`. The `callable` option for `object_id_type` was also removed.
*   **Changes in 1.3.0:**
    *   Settings page to whitelist shortcode keys
    *   Removed sanitization option in favor of `wp_kses_post`
    *  Removed the `wp_filter` parameter
    *   Removed the `callable` option for `object_id_type`
