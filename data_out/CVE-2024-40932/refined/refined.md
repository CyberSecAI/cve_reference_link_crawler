The provided content relates to a memory leak fix in the `exynos_drm_vidi.c` driver, specifically in the `.get_modes()` function. This is not a security vulnerability, but a bug that causes memory to be leaked.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The duplicated EDID is not freed after use in `vidi_get_modes()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A memory leak is present.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is a memory leak which can lead to system instability over time due to resource depletion.
- **Attack vectors**: There is no direct attack vector as it's not exploitable by external actors. The leak happens when the `.get_modes()` function is called, which is a normal part of the driver operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities or position are needed, as the memory leak is triggered by normal system operations.

The fix involves adding a `kfree(edid)` after `drm_add_edid_modes()` to free the allocated memory for the EDID data.
