Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the "number range searcher component" of Jira Server and Jira Data Center.
*   The specific cause is related to how this component handles user-provided input, failing to properly sanitize it, which allows injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. This means that the malicious script is injected into the application through a request, and the application reflects it back in the response, which is then executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTML or JavaScript Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the user's browser.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This injected code can be used to:
    *   Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the web page.
    *   Perform other client-side attacks within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Search Query:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted search query that contains malicious HTML or JavaScript code within the number range search parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must then execute the malicious search, typically by clicking on a crafted link or accessing a specially formatted search page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that this vulnerability exists within the number range search component and understand how to craft the malicious query.
*   **Ability to Deliver the Malicious Link/Query:** The attacker must have a way to get the user to execute the malicious search query, such as through social engineering, phishing, or other manipulation techniques.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.7 and a severity rating of Medium.
*   Affected versions of Jira Server and Data Center are versions before 8.5.14, 8.6.0 to 8.13.6, and 8.14.0 to 8.16.1.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in versions 8.5.14, 8.13.6, 8.16.1, and 8.17.0 and later.
