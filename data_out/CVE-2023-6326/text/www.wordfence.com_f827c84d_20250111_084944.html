### Description

The Master Slider – Responsive Touch Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.10. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'process\_bulk\_action' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate or delete arbitrary sliders via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2023-50900 and CVE-2024-6490 may be a duplicate of this issue.
