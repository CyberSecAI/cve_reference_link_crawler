- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, which will be executed when a user views the page/post. This can lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, redirecting to malicious sites or other unwanted behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** By using a crafted shortcode payload in a post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor role privileges on the WordPress site.
