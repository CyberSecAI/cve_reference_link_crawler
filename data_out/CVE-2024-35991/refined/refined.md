Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-35991.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of a spinlock to protect the event log workqueue in the `idxd` driver. This can lead to a call trace and system instability because `drain_workqueue()` cannot be safely called in a spinlocked context due to possible task rescheduling. Specifically, if `queue_work()` is called while `drain_workqueue()` is running, a call trace can occur, as pushing work on a draining workqueue is not allowed in a spinlocked context.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the incorrect use of a spinlock to protect access to the event log workqueue, which can lead to a race condition and call trace due to task rescheduling when `drain_workqueue()` is called within the spinlock.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a potential call trace, which indicates a kernel panic, and overall system instability. This can lead to denial of service as the system becomes unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through normal driver operation which involves calling the drain_workqueue while a work item is enqueued on the workqueue that is protected by the spinlock. This could be triggered by regular operations involving DMA transfers or other actions processed through the `idxd` driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker does not need special privileges to trigger the vulnerability, it can be triggered by normal usage of the driver through operations that involve the event log. They must be able to cause rescheduling when the driver operations are in progress.
