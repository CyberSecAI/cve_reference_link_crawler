Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `tableedit.php` file of the Sourcecodester Simple Inventory System. Specifically, the `$_POST['from']` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL UPDATE query without any filtering or escaping, which allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from the direct inclusion of user-provided data into a SQL query without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Through error-based SQL injection, an attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, financial data, or other confidential information.
- Data Modification: An attacker can potentially modify or delete data stored in the database, leading to data corruption or denial of service.
- Complete System Compromise: In severe cases, an attacker could potentially gain complete control of the database and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `tableedit.php`, with a maliciously crafted `from` parameter in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the application.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter: The attacker needs to be aware of the `from` parameter being vulnerable within `tableedit.php`
- Authentication: The provided exploit example shows that the attacker needs a valid `PHPSESSID` cookie which requires the attacker to log in to the application (in this case as `admin/admin`).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable application is Sourcecodester Simple Inventory System v1.0.
- The vulnerability is present in the `tableedit.php` file.
- The `$_POST['from']` parameter is the injection point.
- The vulnerability can be exploited via error-based SQL injection.
- The github page also shows an example `sqlmap` command that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
