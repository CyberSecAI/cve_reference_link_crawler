## ***Summary:***

Crow versions prior v1.0+4 (included) are vulnerable to an Information Disclosure
("Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor") issue, due to
improper handling of static resources.
Any request to a static resource, where the static resource is smaller than
16KB, will lead to disclosing up to 16KB of data from the stack.

Affected: Crow version 1.0+4 and older

<https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow> - maintained version (fork)

<https://github.com/ipkn/crow> - original version

CVE ID: [CVE-2022-38668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-38668)

CVSS: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Discovered by:

 Gynvael Coldwind

 hebi

Method of discovery:

 Manual Analysis (reading the code)

> "Crow is a C++ framework for creating HTTP or Websocket web services. It uses
> routing similar to Python's Flask which makes it easy to use. It is also
> extremely fast, beating multiple existing C++ frameworks as well as non C++
> frameworks."

(source: project's README.md)

**IMPORTANT:** This vulnerability is reported under the 90-day policy
(version 2021), i.e. this report will be shared publicly with the defensive
community on 16th November 2022 if a patch/fix is not available by that time, or
30 days after the fix becomes available. For details please see:
<https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/04/policy-and-disclosure-2021-edition.html>

## ***Vulnerability details***

The vulnerability is located in the `Connection::do_write_static`\* method within
the http\_connection.h file.
\*<https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow/blob/master/include/crow/http_connection.h#L393>

This function creates a local buffer with a fixed size of 16384 bytes. Then the
buffer is passed to `is.read()` method (where "is" denotes an opened local file
pointed to by the static resource mapping) to acquire the content of the given
static resource (file). This call made within a while loop's condition, which
checks if any data was read (if not, the loop will exit).

However, the number of bytes that were read is not being tracked in any form.
Furthermore, the whole buffer is then passed to `asio::buffer` without specified
size\*\*.

**\*\*In this case it means that the whole array size will be used as data size, as
per the following constructor description:**

<https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/buffer/overload7.html>

This in turn leads to the whole local buffer being sent to the client requesting
the resource, including the potentially uninitialized part. This is especially
true for files smaller than 16KB.

**Conditions for triggering this behavior are:**

1. Static path needs to be defined.
2. At least 1 static file needs to exist
3. The file needs to be smaller than 16KB.
