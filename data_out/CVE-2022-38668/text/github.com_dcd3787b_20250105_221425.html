It could also cause to return partially incorrect file ending in

case of file not being rounded up to 16KiB.

Thanks to Gynvael Coldwind and hebi for discovering and preparing

report.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| It was already implemented like this. It looks like `asio::write` expects vector of buffers. Also it looks like `asio::buffer` doesn't own memory (<https://think-async.com/Asio/asio-1.22.1/doc/asio/reference/buffer.html#asio.reference.buffer.buffer_invalidation>), so we have to:   * send it buffers vector immediately with only one buffer and then use existing array to load next part of a file (current solution) * copy memory from array (or maybe load data directly to `asio::buffer`) with use of (I guess) `asio::buffer_copy` (<https://think-async.com/Asio/asio-1.22.1/doc/asio/reference/buffer_copy.html>) |

I see, the current solution works fine, no need to add extra copy-operations.

| The vector with size 1 could be constructed outside the loop. And then the asio::buffer would be assigned to the first element in the vector inside the loop. Imo. No copy needed and we would save construction/destruction of a vector in a loop (probably alloc/dealloc) |

| Good point. I didn't want to change anything not connected directly with error, but maybe postponing it is a worse idea :P |
