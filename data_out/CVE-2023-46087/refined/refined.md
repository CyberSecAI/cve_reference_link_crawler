- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site. The specific impact depends on the actions available within the plugin and the targeted user's privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious webpage or link that, when clicked by an authenticated user, triggers a request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious request and lure an authenticated user of the vulnerable WordPress site into triggering it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
