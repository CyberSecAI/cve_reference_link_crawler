The provided content is related to CVE-2024-5997.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `duplicate_user` and `duplicate_post` functions of the Duplica WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to trigger the duplication of users and posts/pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can create duplicates of users and posts/pages. This can potentially lead to:
    - Content duplication and clutter
    - Creation of malicious user accounts
    - Resource exhaustion
    - Unintended modifications of the website data and structure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted AJAX requests to the `duplicate_user` and `duplicate_post` functions, which are accessible to authenticated users with minimal privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Subscriber-level access to the WordPress website.
- No special privileges or administrator rights are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Duplica plugin up to and including 0.6.
- The `wp_verify_nonce` function is used, which prevents CSRF attacks but does not check if the user has the right capability to perform the intended action.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a capability check before the execution of `duplicate_user` and `duplicate_post` functions.
