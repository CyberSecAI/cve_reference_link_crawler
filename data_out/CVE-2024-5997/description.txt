The Duplica â€“ Duplicate Posts, Pages, Custom Posts or Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the duplicate_user and duplicate_post functions in all versions up to, and including, 0.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create duplicates of users and posts/pages.
