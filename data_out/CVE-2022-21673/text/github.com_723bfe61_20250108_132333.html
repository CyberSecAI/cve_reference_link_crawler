# Forward OAuth Identity Token can allow users to access some data sources

Moderate

[kminehart](/kminehart)
published
GHSA-8wjh-59cw-9xh4
Jan 18, 2022

## Package

Forward OAuth Identity / OAuth Passthrough
(Grafana)

## Affected versions

> 7.2.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

When a data source has the Forward OAuth Identity feature enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API token (and no other user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the most recently logged-in user.

This can allow API token holders to retrieve data for which they may not have intended access.

### Impact

All of the following must be true:

* The Grafana instance has data sources that support the Forward OAuth Identity feature. Graphite users, for example.
  + Some data sources are not susceptible, like Prometheus, as they do not have support for this feature.
  + The option being available is not sufficient enough to determine if the data source is susceptible.
* The Grafana instance has a data source with the Forward OAuth Identity feature toggled on.
* The Grafana instance has OAuth enabled.
* The Grafana instance has usable API keys.

### Patches

The following Grafana versions have been patched:

* `v8.3.4`
* `v7.5.13`

### Workarounds

Administrators of Grafana instances can limit the availability of API tokens.

### Reporting security issues

If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@grafana.com. This address can be used for all of Grafana Labs' open source and commercial products (including, but not limited to Grafana, Grafana Cloud, Grafana Enterprise, and grafana.com). We can accept only vulnerability reports at this address. We would prefer that you encrypt your message to us by using our PGP key. The key fingerprint is

F988 7BEA 027A 049F AE8E 5CAA D125 8932 BE24 C5CA

The key is available from keyserver.ubuntu.com.

### Security announcements

We maintain a [security category](https://community.grafana.com/c/support/security-announcements) on our blog, where we will always post a summary, remediation, and mitigation details for any patch containing security fixes.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
