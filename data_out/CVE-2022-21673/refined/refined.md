Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21673:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Grafana handles OAuth identity forwarding when a data source has the "Forward OAuth Identity" feature enabled. When a query is sent to such a data source using an API token, Grafana incorrectly forwards the OAuth identity of the *most recently logged-in user* instead of the user associated with the API token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect OAuth Identity Forwarding:** Grafana forwards the OAuth identity of the most recent user instead of the user associated with the API token.
*   **Bypass of Intended Access Controls:** API token holders can potentially retrieve data they were not intended to access based on the permissions of the most recently logged-in user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker with a valid API token can potentially access data from a data source that they are not authorized to view, provided a privileged user had recently authenticated.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information could be exposed due to the incorrect forwarding of OAuth identities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs a valid Grafana API token.
*   The attacker sends a query to a Grafana data source with "Forward OAuth Identity" enabled.
*  The attacker doesn't need to be the most recent user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Grafana API token:** The attacker must possess a valid API token of a Grafana instance
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable data sources:** The attacker must have knowledge of Grafana data sources with "Forward OAuth Identity" enabled.
*   **Grafana instance with OAuth enabled and at least one user authenticated via OAuth.** The targeted Grafana instance must have OAuth authentication enabled, and a user must have recently authenticated with OAuth.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Grafana versions prior to 7.5.13 and 8.3.4 are vulnerable. Specifically, versions 7.2.0 and later are mentioned as affected.
*   **Affected Data Sources:** Data sources with "Forward OAuth Identity" feature enabled are vulnerable, such as Graphite. Prometheus is mentioned as an example of a data source not vulnerable because it lacks support for this feature.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability has been patched in Grafana versions 7.5.13 and 8.3.4.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 4.3
*   **NetApp:** Multiple NetApp products incorporate Grafana, and are also vulnerable.

In summary, CVE-2022-21673 is a vulnerability in Grafana where OAuth identity is incorrectly forwarded, leading to potential unauthorized access to data sources when using API tokens. The vulnerability can be exploited with a valid API token on a Grafana instance configured to use OAuth and having data sources with the "Forward OAuth Identity" feature enabled.
