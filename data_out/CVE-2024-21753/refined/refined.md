- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper limitation of pathnames to a restricted directory, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal (CWE-23) vulnerability in FortiClientEMS management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote and authenticated attacker can retrieve or delete arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem. This can lead to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Specially crafted web requests sent to the FortiClientEMS management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the FortiClientEMS management interface.
