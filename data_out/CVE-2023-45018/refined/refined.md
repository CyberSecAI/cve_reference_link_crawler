Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45018:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from fluidattacks.com directly references CVE-2023-45018 and describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the 'Online Bus Booking System v1.0', specifically within the `includes/login.php` resource. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input validation for the `username` parameter in the `includes/login.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied data (`$_POST['username']`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially gain access to the entire user database.
*   **Account Takeover:** Malicious queries could be crafted to bypass authentication, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and administrative functions.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, the attacker could gain access to the underlying server by injecting specific SQL commands.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `includes/login.php` resource.
*   **Malicious Payload:** The attacker includes SQL injection code within the `username` parameter in the POST request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, which means anyone with network access can exploit it.
*  **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs some understanding of SQL to craft an appropriate malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet from `includes/login.php` is:

```php
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'";
$select_user = mysqli_query($connection,$query);
```

*   The SQL query directly concatenates the `$username` variable into the SQL statement without any escaping or parameterization, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fluidattacks.com content provides more detailed information than the standard CVE description.
*   The vulnerability is present in Online Bus Booking System v1.0 from Projectworlds Pvt. Limited.
*   Multiple related SQL injection vulnerabilities were found within the same application.
*   There is currently no patch for this vulnerability.
