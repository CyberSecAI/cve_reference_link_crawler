Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data. The PMB application is vulnerable to insecure deserialization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code through crafted serialized data.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data is the identified vulnerability. This occurs because the PMB application does not properly validate or sanitize serialized data before deserializing it, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled code.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**  Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Inclusion, meaning an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the deserialization of untrusted data. The specific method of injecting the malicious serialized data isn't specified in this document but would likely involve sending a crafted request to the PMB application.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send malicious data to the PMB application that will be deserialized. The attacker would likely require network access to the server.

**Affected Versions:**

*   PMB versions from 7.4.1 before 7.4.9
*   PMB versions from 7.3.1 before 7.3.18
*   PMB versions from 7.5.1 before 7.5.6-2
