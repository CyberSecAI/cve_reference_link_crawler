- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Credentials (passwords) were stored in plaintext in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure, specifically the ability to extract plaintext passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to the database is required to exploit the vulnerability, after which the plaintext passwords can be extracted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the database to be able to read the plaintext passwords.
