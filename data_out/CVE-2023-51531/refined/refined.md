- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Thrive Automator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on their behalf, using the user's current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case depending on the actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out by a cross-site request, meaning the attacker would trick a logged-in user into submitting a forged request to the vulnerable site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user of the WordPress site into triggering a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
