- **Root cause of vulnerability**: NULL Pointer Dereference
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in Adobe InDesign.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to application denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), with low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), and user interaction required (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to convince a user to open a specially crafted file.
