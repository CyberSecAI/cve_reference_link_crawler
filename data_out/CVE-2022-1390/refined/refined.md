{
  "CVE-2022-1390": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not validate the path parameter given to `readfile()`. This allows an attacker to control the file being read.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Path traversal",
      "Unauthenticated arbitrary file read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files on the server. If the server is running an old version of PHP susceptible to the null byte technique, it could also lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Phar Deserialization.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable `download-csv.php` file, providing a `path` parameter with the file path they want to read, such as `/etc/passwd`. A null byte (`\0`) may be needed to bypass file extension checks on older PHP versions.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress plugin, and does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability."
