GHSA-v6q4-h869-gm3r
Jul 30, 2024

## Package

composer

Xibo CMS
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>=2.1.0,<3.3.12,<4.0.14

## Patched versions

>=3.3.12,>=4.0.14

## Description

### Impact

An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the `report/data/proofofplayReport` API route inside the CMS. This allows an authenticated user to to obtain and modify arbitrary data from the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values in to the `sortBy` parameter.

Exploitation of the vulnerability is possible on behalf of an authorized user who has the following privileges:

- Access to Reporting feature

- View access to arbitrary display

This is only possible for CMS instances configured to use MySQL as their time series store, which is the default configuration.

### Patches

**Users should upgrade to version 3.3.12 or 4.0.14 which fix this issue**. Customers who host their CMS with Xibo Signage were not effected by this advisory.

### Workarounds

Upgrading to a fixed version is necessary to remediate.

Patches are available for earlier versions of Xibo CMS that are out of security support:

* [2.3 patch](https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/commit/c60cfd8727da77b9db10297148eadd697ebec353.patch)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
