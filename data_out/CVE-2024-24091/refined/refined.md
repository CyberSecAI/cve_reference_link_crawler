Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the file upload interface of the Yealink Meeting Server, which is susceptible to OS command injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input during the file upload process. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute commands with root-level privileges on the affected system. This can lead to a full compromise of the server, including data breaches, denial of service, and further malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is the file upload interface of the Yealink Meeting Server. By manipulating the uploaded file content or filename, an attacker can inject OS commands.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have access to the vulnerable file upload interface and be able to manipulate the file upload process to inject malicious commands. The exact position or authentication requirements are not detailed, but some level of access is likely needed.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability is specific to Yealink Meeting Server versions prior to V26.0.0.66.
* The vendor recommends upgrading to the latest version V26.0.0.66 to fix this issue.
