### Description

The QA Analytics – Web Analytics Tool with Heatmaps & Session Replay Across All Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax\_save\_plugin\_config() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.1.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings.
