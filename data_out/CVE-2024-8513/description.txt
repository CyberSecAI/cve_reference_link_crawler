The QA Analytics â€“ Web Analytics Tool with Heatmaps & Session Replay Across All Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_save_plugin_config() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.0.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings.
