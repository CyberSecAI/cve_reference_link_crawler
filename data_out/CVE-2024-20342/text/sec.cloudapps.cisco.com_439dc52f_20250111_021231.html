This vulnerability is due to an incorrect connection count comparison. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device at a rate that exceeds a configured rate filter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to successfully bypass the rate filter. This could allow unintended traffic to enter the network protected by the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-rf-bypass-OY8f3pnM>  This advisory is part of the October 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: October 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Open Source Snort 2 and Open Source Snort 3.  At the time of publication, this vulnerability also affected Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco FirePOWER Services or Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software and had Snort enabled.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. For more information on Snort, see the [Snort website](https://www.snort.org/). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Cyber Vision Software   + Meraki products   + Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software   + Unified Threat Defense (UTD) Software  Details  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass protections that are provided by a rate filter that is applied on an affected device. The overall impact of exploitation is organization specific because it depends on the importance of the assets that the rate filter was supposed to protect. Customers should evaluate how exploitation of this vulnerability would impact their network and proceed according to their own vulnerability-handling and remediation processes.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, the release information in the following tables was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  The left column lists software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.       | Cisco FTD Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 7.0 and earlier | 7.0.6.2 |   | 7.1 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 7.2 | 7.2.6 |   | 7.3 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 7.4 | 7.4.2.1 |   | 7.6 | Not vulnerable. |       **Note:** Snort 2 will not be fixed and the fixed releases that are listed in the preceding table require enabling Snort 3. To enable Snort 3 using Cisco FMC, see the [Firepower Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/snort3/config-guide/snort3-configuration-guide-v70/migrating.html). To enable Snort 3 on a standalone device using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), see [Switching Between Snort 2 and Snort 3](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-700/fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#id_120089) in the *Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager* guide.          | Open Source Snort Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | Snort 2 | Migrate to Snort 3. |   | Snort 3 | 3.1.74.0 |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.  Source  * This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
