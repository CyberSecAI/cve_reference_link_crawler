{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the body field of a new post, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'body' field of a new post within the Netlify CMS interface. An attacker injects the XSS payload in this field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have access to create new posts within the Netlify CMS interface."
