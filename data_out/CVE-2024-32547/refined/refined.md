- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Code Insert Manager (Q2W3 Inc Manager) WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin allows for the injection of malicious scripts due to insufficient input sanitization or output encoding.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site, potentially leading to various malicious outcomes, including unauthorized actions, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin itself, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
