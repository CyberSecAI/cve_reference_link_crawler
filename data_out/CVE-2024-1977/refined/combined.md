### Description

The Restaurant Solutions – Checklist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Checklist points in version 1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.
