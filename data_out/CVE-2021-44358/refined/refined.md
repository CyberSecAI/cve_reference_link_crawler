Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-44358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser of the Reolink RLC-410W camera. Specifically, the `SetRec` command's JSON parameter parser incorrectly assumes the `param` field will always be a JSON object. When the `param` field is a different type (e.g., an empty string), the parser attempts to use the subscription operator on it, leading to a failed assertion and subsequent process termination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The `cgiserver.cgi` does not properly validate the type of the JSON `param` field before attempting to access its members.
*   **Type Confusion:** The code assumes the `param` field is a JSON object, leading to a type mismatch when it is a different type.
*   **Lack of Error Handling:** Instead of gracefully handling a non-object `param` field, the code triggers an assertion, leading to process termination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability causes the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate due to an assertion failure.
*   **Device Reboot:** Because the `cgiserver.cgi` process manages the API requests, the termination causes the device to reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** A specially-crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint, including a JSON payload with the vulnerable command and an invalid `param` field type.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web server.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker must know the specific command name (`SetRec`) and the structure of the JSON request.
*   **Session Token (Potentially):** While some exploitation scenarios require a session token, this vulnerability can potentially be triggered without authentication by exploiting another vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420).

**Specific Details for CVE-2021-44358**
