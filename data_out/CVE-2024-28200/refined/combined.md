# 2024.2 Release Notes

**Build Number**: 2024.2.0.20 **Last updated**: 7/1/2024

## What's New

#### Security Enhancements

This upgrade includes additional enhancements to address a critical security fix, first addressed in 2023.9 HF1. ([CVE-2024-28200](https://status.n-able.com/2024/07/02/n-central-critical-security-fix-details/))

#### REST API Endpoint Additions

There are several new REST API endpoints included in 2024.2! These updates include endpoints with GET methods for:

* Organization Units Custom Properties
* Device Custom Properties
* Devices List by FilterID
* Access Groups
* Active Issues
* Job Statuses
* User Roles
* Organization Units Children
* Devices Service Monitor Status
* Standard PSA Credentials Validation
* Custom PSA Ticket Details
* System Version Information

After upgrading to 2024.2, you can view the updated list of REST API endpoints by navigating to your Swagger Documentation page located at https://Your\_FQDN/api-explorer/. There is also an âAPI Explorerâ link added to the âMy Linksâ menu in the N-central UI that will navigate to your Swagger page. Note that new endpoints are initially released in a preview state so they will have âPreviewâ prepended to the endpoint description.

#### Patch CVSS Score Color Indicators

The patch CVSS scoring that was implemented in 2024.1 has been improved upon to introduce color indicators to the CVSS scores in patch workflows. In addition to seeing the CVSS score for a given patch, you can now correlate the CVSS rating to the given color for that range. For example, a patch with a critical CVSS score (9.0-10.0) will have a red indicator and a patch with a low CVSS score (0.1-3.9) will have a green indicator.

#### New Mac Device Class and Scripts

A new Device Class has been added for Apple devices called âLaptop â Macâ to add more granularity to Mac device classifications and provide more accurate inventory reporting as a result. Previously, all Mac devices were classified as âWorkstations â Macâ regardless of being a workstation or laptop. Rules and filters have been updated to accommodate this new device class.

Many new âout-of-the-boxâ scripts have also been added to the repository to assist with routine automation for Mac devices. These scripts could previously be found in the automation cookbooks on N-ableMe, but they have been added to the product itself for convenience.

#### Cove Backup Stock Service Templates

New stock service templates have been added which contain the new âCove Backup Job Statusâ and âCove App Monitoringâ services. These service templates will apply the new stock services when Cove backup is detected as installed on a device.

#### Update Asset Info in Bulk

This release includes the ability to run an 'Update Asset Info' task in bulk, for multiple devices at the same time. To perform a bulk asset info update within the N-central UI, navigate to the 'All Devices' or 'Active Issues' screen, select multiple devices and then select 'Update Asset Info' from the 'Add Task' menu.

#### Service Template Performance Improvements

This release includes valuable improvements to the performance of service template application/re-application. Applying service templates to many devices will be much faster from leveraging cached data to improve the speed in which this data is processed.

#### Take Control Mac Viewer Update (6.00.57)

Here's what's new with the Take Control Mac viewer:

* Fixed several issues with the update process
* Corrected an issue with folder names that contain special characters
* Optimized the way that the Viewer is loaded to decrease errors and enhance performance
* Corrected issues with the display of icons in the Dock
* Changed the storage location for the session video recordings
* Fixed German localization issues

#### Top Big Fixes

NCCF-15587: Daylight savings (DST) is causing incorrectly calculated sessionexpiry resulting in Agent Status services to transition to misconfigured

NCCF-32981: Services such as the Interface Health and Traffic service are not loading the selected Interface when accessing the service a second time

NCCF-137418: Saving Remote Control settings without a timeout value on a device fails with system Error Pop up

NCCF-20749: System Error When Bulk Deleting Devices (5000 Error processing cascading delete)

NCCF-121754: Some Manufacturers Do not Update `Win32\_SystemEnclosure` Which Causes Serial Number to Not Be Listed

KUIP-5625: High network utilization after installing N-central agent due to duplicate downloads of ecosystem files

NCCF-72854: Filter "Agent Version" Is Not Including "reportedapplianceversion" resulting in incorrect filter results

NCCF-129738: Depending on options selected in the PSA customer mapping, records may disappear until refreshed

NCCF-130662: Filter imports are failing to detect the name of the filter being imported, resulting in the inability to import filters

NCCF-146113: Windows agent/probe certificate validation needs to handle closed environments that cannot communicate with revocation server

NCCF-163622: Probe updater should kill any N-able process that is still running during update to improve upgrade reliability

NCCF-216121: Leverage ThreadLocal caching for of previous integration checks to improve performance of customerListScanTargets

## Post GA releases

#### New N-able login available for hosted partners!

Released: 5/3/2024

N-able login capabilities (MSP SSO) are now integrated into your N-central instance! We encourage you to enroll if you are using local login and shift to this new method of authentication.

We know that our partners use many tools and are burdened with managing multiple vendors and multiple logins per vendor. Our new login solution is set to solve that by providing you with seamless authentication and access to our products and our comprehensive success resources.

By shifting from local authentication to MSP SSO you will gain:

* Security managed by our ISO certified security standards with MFA.
* Quick access to our partner success resources such as knowledge, support, N-able University training, communities, and Market Builder.
* Seamlessly movement between other N-able products such as Cove, Take Control, Passportal, and more.

Looking ahead, we will be integrating with additional 3rd-party identity providers directly in MSP SSO, such as Entra ID, so that you can have a single location to manage your N-able authentication across your entire N-able universe.

To learn how to enroll your users click [here](https://documentation.n-able.com/N-central/userguide/Content/User_Management/MSP_SSO_authentication.htm).

#### Analytics Patch Data Model Improvement

Released: 4/30/2024

We've made an improvement to the Analytics Patch Data model that removes patches that are no longer required from your Analytics views. Especially patches in the statuses âNo Approvalâ or âPendingâ that don't appear in Patch Management will no longer show in the Analytics Patch Compliance dashboard, improving compliance scores.

#### N-central Mac Agent Version v1.11.0.562

Released: 5/13/2024

* New Firewall Status monitor

  A new out-of-the-box monitor has been added to show you the status of the devices' firewall. The monitor accompanies the firewall enable/disable script that was added to the most recent N-central version, allowing you to action changes if needed.

* Improved Asset information gathering and visibility

  The agent's ability to gather and show asset information has been improved to ensure various asset fields are correctly filled in.

#### Patch Management Engine 2.11.2RC

Released: 5/13/2024

* Windows 11 Upgrade Improvements N-central

  Ensures the latest version of Windows 11 is always used when upgrading from Windows 10.
* Cumulative update install improvements (offline patching only)

  Improved install logic for cumulative updates to prioritize msu installers instead of cab installers.
* Registry Key Control Changes (N-central only)

  Fixed issue where the wrong registry key settings were being applied for the profile setting "Limited to Administrators Only".

## Upgrade Paths and Notes

If you are an On-Prem partner upgrading from 2024.1 and previously applied the performance code drop for 2024.1, please contact support to have an additional code drop applied after upgrading to 2024.2. This will ensure that the fixes in the original code drop are also applied after upgrading.

To upgrade to N-able N-central 2024.2, your N-able N-central server must be running the following version:

* N-able N-central 2022.7.1.44
* N-able N-central 2023.4.0.32
* N-able N-central 2023.5.0.12
* N-able N-central 2023.6.0.9
* N-able N-central 2023.7.0.10+
* N-able N-central 2023.8.0.11+
* N-able N-central 2023.9.0.25
* N-able N-central 2023.9.0.26
* N-able N-central 2023.9.1.30
* N-able N-central 2024.1.0.17

Note the following when upgrading N-able N-central.

Tasks may expire if the agent on an associated device is being upgraded when the task is scheduled to be completed. Agent upgrades are normally short in duration but a delay may happen if a device re-start is pending.

## Included updates in N-able N-central

#### N-central 2024.2

If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2023.9, please note that because of the PostgreSQL upgrade included with N-central 2023.9, on-premise partners can expect this upgrade to take longer than previous upgrades may have. Please do NOT reboot your N-central server if the upgrade appears to be stuck. Please check the server console for error messages, or contact Support and they can advise on the progress and status of the upgrade.

#### Dashboards

| Description | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| Modifying a Dashboard that is associated with a large number of services may cause performance issues when using the Firefox browser. | 70326 |

#### PSA Integration

| Description | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| In some instances, tickets closed in PSAs are not being cleared in N-able N-central. This is likely because the ticketing recipient profile in N-able N-central has Do not change the Ticket Status selected (in order to manually configure tickets). Then, when the ticket is removed in the PSA, N-able N-central will not be able to update or resolve the ticket's status and new tickets cannot be created for the same issue. Until a solution is available through the UI for this situation, the work around is to set a Return to Normal status and set a non-used status in the 'updatable statuses' section or set the same status as the return to normal one. This will cause N-able N-central to add a note to the ticket on return to normal but will not alter the ticket's status. This will allow the stale ticket check to remove the ticket from the system. | 65620 |

#### UI

| Description | Bug |
| --- | --- |
| When Cove Data Protection is installed on a device, the device details view will not light up the Cove icon in the features row correctly. | NCCF-162108 |
