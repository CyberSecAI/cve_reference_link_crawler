Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-35650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient path checks when importing lesson questions within Moodle. This lack of proper validation allows for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use directory traversal techniques to navigate the file system beyond the intended directory, potentially accessing sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can read potentially sensitive files that may contain configuration information, user data, or other confidential information from the Moodle server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Import Lesson Questions Feature:** The vulnerability is specifically located within the "import lesson questions" functionality.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The attacker manipulates input parameters related to file paths, using ".." sequences or similar methods to traverse to unintended directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The vulnerability is only accessible to users with the ability to access the "import lesson questions" feature. By default, this includes teachers, managers, and administrators within the Moodle platform.
*   **Ability to Manipulate File Paths:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the file path parameters to execute the directory traversal.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by "loknop"
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Moodle versions 4.0.2, 3.11.8, and 3.9.15.
*   The fix involves implementing proper path validation to prevent directory traversal.
*   This issue is tracked as MDL-72029 in the Moodle tracker.
