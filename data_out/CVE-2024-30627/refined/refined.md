{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `saveParentControlInfo` function lacks proper length checks when handling the `deviceId` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow. The function copies the user-provided `deviceId` parameter to a stack buffer without validating its length.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute a denial of service attack or remote code execution with carefully crafted overflow data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint with a long `deviceId` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device's web interface."
