Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formexeCommand` function of the Tenda AC500 V2.0.1.9(1307) firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `formexeCommand` function receives a `cmdinput` parameter from a POST request.
- This `cmdinput` parameter's value is assigned to the `src` variable and later copied to a fixed-size 512-byte buffer `s` using `strcpy(s, src)`.
- There is no check on the length of the `cmdinput` before copying, making it possible to overflow the `s` buffer with a user-controlled input exceeding 512 bytes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful stack overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device. An attacker could overwrite parts of the stack, including the return address, thus gaining control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/execCommand` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to include a `cmdinput` parameter in the POST request with a value larger than 512 bytes to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. This likely means the attacker needs to be on the same network as the device or have some form of access to send requests to the deviceâ€™s web server.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL (`/goform/execCommand`) and the parameter (`cmdinput`).

**Additional Information:**
- A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a `cmdinput` parameter of 1000 "A" characters.
