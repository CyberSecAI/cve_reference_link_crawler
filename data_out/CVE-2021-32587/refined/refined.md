- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer GUI interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient access control allows a remote, authenticated attacker with a restricted user profile to retrieve the list of administrative users of other ADOMs and their related configurations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information regarding administrative users and their configurations across different ADOMs. This could potentially lead to further attacks, privilege escalation or unauthorized access to other resources and functionalities.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access through the FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer GUI interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with a restricted user profile.
