Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.21.4 and 1.20.11, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 2 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* path/filepath: recognize \??\ as a Root Local Device path prefix.

  On Windows, a path beginning with \??\ is a Root Local Device path equivalent

  to a path beginning with \\?\. Paths with a \??\ prefix may be used to

  access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path \??\c:\x

  is equivalent to the more common path c:\x.

  The filepath package did not recognize paths with a \??\ prefix as special.

  Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into

  the root local device path \??\b. It will now convert this

  path into .\??\b.

  IsAbs did not report paths beginning with \??\ as absolute.

  It now does so.

  VolumeName now reports the \??\ prefix as a volume name.

  Join(`\`, `??`, `b`) could convert a seemingly innocent

  sequence of path elements into the root local device path

  \??\b. It will now convert this to \.\??\b.

  This is CVE-2023-45283 and <https://go.dev/issue/63713>.
* path/filepath: recognize device names with trailing spaces and superscripts

  The IsLocal function did not correctly detect reserved names in some cases:

  + reserved names followed by spaces, such as "COM1 ".
  + "COM" or "LPT" followed by a superscript 1, 2, or 3.

  IsLocal now correctly reports these names as non-local.

  This is CVE-2023-45284 and <https://go.dev/issue/63713>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.21.4>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.21.4` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Heschi and Cherry for the Go team

On Windows, A root local device path is a path which begins with
\\?\ or \??\.  A root local device path accesses the DosDevices
object directory, and permits access to any file or device on the
system. For example \??\C:\foo is equivalent to common C:\foo.

The Clean, IsAbs, IsLocal, and VolumeName functions did not
recognize root local device paths beginning with \??\.

Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into
the root local device path \??\b. It will now convert this
path into .\??\b.

IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\
as absolute.

IsLocal now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\
as non-local.

VolumeName now reports the \??\ prefix as a volume name.

Join(`\`, `??`, `b`) could convert a seemingly innocent
sequence of path elements into the root local device path
\??\b. It will now convert this to \.\??\b.

In addition, the IsLocal function did not correctly
detect reserved names in some cases:

  - reserved names followed by spaces, such as \"COM1 \".
  - \"COM\" or \"LPT\" followed by a superscript 1, 2, or 3.

IsLocal now correctly reports these names as non-local.

cherry-picked to include expected functions and tests expected in the CVE fix commit.
Additionally, for the purpose of tests I added the line to api/go1.19.txt which is used for checking the
function calls exist as expected.

# Original Information

On Windows, A root local device path is a path which begins with
\\?\ or \??\.  A root local device path accesses the DosDevices
object directory, and permits access to any file or device on the
system. For example \??\C:\foo is equivalent to common C:\foo.

The Clean, IsAbs, IsLocal, and VolumeName functions did not
recognize root local device paths beginning with \??\.

Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into
the root local device path \??\b. It will now convert this
path into .\??\b.

IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\
as absolute.

IsLocal now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\
as non-local.

VolumeName now reports the \??\ prefix as a volume name.

Join(`\`, `??`, `b`) could convert a seemingly innocent
sequence of path elements into the root local device path
\??\b. It will now convert this to \.\??\b.

In addition, the IsLocal function did not correctly
detect reserved names in some cases:

  - reserved names followed by spaces, such as \"COM1 \".
  - \"COM\" or \"LPT\" followed by a superscript 1, 2, or 3.

IsLocal now correctly reports these names as non-local.

path/filepath: add IsLocal

IsLocal reports whether a path lexically refers to a location
contained within the directory in which it is evaluated.
It identifies paths that are absolute, escape a directory
with \"..\" elements, and (on Windows) paths that reference
reserved device names.

In addition to the CVE fix [golang@46fb781](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/46fb78168596f7ce8834f528bb0eb9555c08bcae),

[golang@45b98bf](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/45b98bfb793923c539f9a959c3047d2e5fe2ebf0) &
[golang@6d0bf43](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/6d0bf438e302afcb0db5422ea2da59d1995e08c1) were
cherry-picked to include expected functions and tests expected in the CVE fix commit.
Additionally, for the purpose of tests I added the line to api/go1.19.txt which is used for checking the
function calls exist as expected.

# Original Information

On Windows, A root local device path is a path which begins with
\\?\ or \??\.  A root local device path accesses the DosDevices
object directory, and permits access to any file or device on the
system. For example \??\C:\foo is equivalent to common C:\foo.

The Clean, IsAbs, IsLocal, and VolumeName functions did not
recognize root local device paths beginning with \??\.

Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into
the root local device path \??\b. It will now convert this
path into .\??\b.

IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\
as absolute.

IsLocal now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\
as non-local.

VolumeName now reports the \??\ prefix as a volume name.

Join(`\`, `??`, `b`) could convert a seemingly innocent
sequence of path elements into the root local device path
\??\b. It will now convert this to \.\??\b.

In addition, the IsLocal function did not correctly
detect reserved names in some cases:

  - reserved names followed by spaces, such as "COM1 ".
  - "COM" or "LPT" followed by a superscript 1, 2, or 3.

IsLocal now correctly reports these names as non-local.

[release-branch.go1.21] path/filepath: don't drop .. elements when cleaning invalid Windows paths

Fix a bug where Clean could improperly drop .. elements from a
path on Windows, when the path contains elements containing a ':'.

For example, Clean("a/../b:/../../c") now correctly returns "..\c"
rather than "c".

path/filepath: add IsLocal

IsLocal reports whether a path lexically refers to a location
contained within the directory in which it is evaluated.
It identifies paths that are absolute, escape a directory
with ".." elements, and (on Windows) paths that reference
reserved device names.
