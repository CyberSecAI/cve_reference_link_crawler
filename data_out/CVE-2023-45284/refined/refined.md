{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `IsLocal` function in the `path/filepath` package on Windows did not correctly detect reserved device names.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `IsLocal` function incorrectly identified reserved names followed by spaces, such as `COM1 `, and reserved names `COM` or `LPT` followed by superscript 1, 2, or 3 as local paths, which they are not."
    ],
    "impact": "Incorrectly identifying device names as local could lead to security vulnerabilities if those names were used in path manipulation or access control decisions, potentially allowing access to unintended resources.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could craft paths containing reserved device names (e.g., `COM1 `, `COM¹`, `LPT²` ) that are incorrectly identified as local by the `IsLocal` function, leading to unintended consequences.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to control or influence the path strings being processed by the vulnerable application on Windows systems."
