| path/filepath: recognize `\??\` as a Root Local Device path prefix.  On Windows, a path beginning with `\??\` is a Root Local Device path equivalent to a path beginning with `\\?\`. Paths with a `\??\` prefix may be used to access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path `\??\c:\x` is equivalent to the more common path `c:\x`.  The filepath package did not recognize paths with a `\??\` prefix as special.  Clean could convert a rooted path such as `\a\..\??\b` into the root local device path `\??\b`. It will now convert this path into `.\??\b`.  IsAbs did not report paths beginning with `\??\` as absolute. It now does so.  VolumeName now reports the `\??\` prefix as a volume name.  `Join(`\`, `??`, `b`)` could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into the root local device path `\??\b`. It will now convert this to `\.\??\b`.

On Windows, A root local device path is a path which begins with
\\?\ or \??\.  A root local device path accesses the DosDevices
object directory, and permits access to any file or device on the
system. For example \??\C:\foo is equivalent to common C:\foo.

The Clean, IsAbs, IsLocal, and VolumeName functions did not
recognize root local device paths beginning with \??\.

Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into
the root local device path \??\b. It will now convert this
path into .\??\b.

IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\
as absolute.

IsLocal now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\
as non-local.

VolumeName now reports the \??\ prefix as a volume name.

Join(`\`, `??`, `b`) could convert a seemingly innocent
sequence of path elements into the root local device path
\??\b. It will now convert this to \.\??\b.

In addition, the IsLocal function did not correctly
detect reserved names in some cases:

  - reserved names followed by spaces, such as \"COM1 \".
  - \"COM\" or \"LPT\" followed by a superscript 1, 2, or 3.

IsLocal now correctly reports these names as non-local.

This had the consequences of breaking the MkdirAll tests which were
looking for specific error messages which changed and using invalid

In particular under go1.21.3:

    filepath.VolumeName(`\\?\C:`) == `\\?\C:`

But under go1.21.4 it is:

    filepath.VolumeName(`\\?\C:`) == `\\?`

The path `\\?\C:` isn't actually a valid Windows path. I reported this
as a FYI bug upstream - I'm not expecting it to be fixed.

https://github.com/golang/go/commit/6d0bf438e302afcb0db5422ea2da59d1995e08c1 were
cherry-picked to include expected functions and tests expected in the CVE fix commit.
Additionally, for the purpose of tests I added the line to api/go1.19.txt which is used for checking the
function calls exist as expected.

# Original Information

On Windows, A root local device path is a path which begins with
\\?\ or \??\.  A root local device path accesses the DosDevices
object directory, and permits access to any file or device on the
system. For example \??\C:\foo is equivalent to common C:\foo.

The Clean, IsAbs, IsLocal, and VolumeName functions did not
recognize root local device paths beginning with \??\.

Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into
the root local device path \??\b. It will now convert this
path into .\??\b.

IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\
as absolute.

IsLocal now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\
as non-local.

VolumeName now reports the \??\ prefix as a volume name.

Join(`\`, `??`, `b`) could convert a seemingly innocent
sequence of path elements into the root local device path
\??\b. It will now convert this to \.\??\b.

In addition, the IsLocal function did not correctly
detect reserved names in some cases:

  - reserved names followed by spaces, such as \"COM1 \".
  - \"COM\" or \"LPT\" followed by a superscript 1, 2, or 3.

IsLocal now correctly reports these names as non-local.

It identifies paths that are absolute, escape a directory
