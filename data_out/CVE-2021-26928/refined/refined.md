The provided content is a blog post from CyberArk detailing a vulnerability in Kubernetes network plugins using BGP routing daemons, specifically focusing on Calico. The content directly mentions the CVE ID, indicating it is related to CVE-2021-26928.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in a combination of factors:
1.  **BGP's Graceful Restart Capability:** The BGP Graceful Restart mechanism (defined in RFC4724) allows a new TCP session from the same peer to drop an existing established connection. This behavior, intended for seamless restarts, creates a race condition vulnerability allowing an attacker to "steal" the BGP session.
2.  **Lack of secure BGP configuration:** The default configuration of Calico's BIRD daemon does not implement strong authentication mechanisms (like TCP-MD5) for BGP peers, making it easier to hijack sessions.
3.  **Overlooked security issue in RFC4724**: An attacker can exploit the "Unsupported Optional Parameter" NOTIFICATION message to downgrade BGP sessions, stripping the graceful restart capability and allowing a malicious actor to persistently hijack the BGP session by winning a race condition.
4.  **Kubernetes environment differences**: Unlike traditional internet infrastructure where BGP daemons are hardened, routing daemons within Kubernetes clusters operate within a full operating system, exposing them to a broader range of attack vectors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **BGP Session Hijacking:** The ability to steal and manipulate a BGP session to inject malicious routing updates.
*   **Lack of BGP Authentication:** The absence of authentication mechanisms like TCP-MD5 to prevent unauthorized BGP peers.
*  **Vulnerability in RFC4724:** The ability to downgrade the BGP session by exploiting an "Unsupported Optional Parameter" NOTIFICATION message and strip the Graceful Restart Capability
*   **Exploitable Graceful Restart:** The BGP's Graceful Restart Capability can be abused by attackers
*   **Insecure Pod Configuration:** Usage of `hostNetwork` on pods without proper security measures.
*   **Missing NET_RAW capability restriction:** Lack of restrictions on the `NET_RAW` capability for pods, allowing them to manipulate packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks:** By controlling routing updates, attackers can redirect traffic through their own server, allowing them to intercept and potentially modify sensitive data. This can be performed on a broad multi-subnet network.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By hijacking or disrupting the BGP session, attackers can prevent proper routing updates.
*   **Persistent Hijacking:** By exploiting the overlooked RFC4724 security issue, attackers can persistently control the BGP session and inject malicious updates.
*   **Traffic Redirection:** Attackers can redirect traffic to external servers (even outside the cluster)

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Compromised Pod:** An attacker compromises a pod running in `hostNetwork` mode on a node.
*   **Compromised Node:** An attacker gains low-privilege access on a node.
*   **Network Level Access:** An attacker with the ability to intercept or manipulate network traffic to the BGP port

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Low-privileged user access on a Kubernetes node (master or worker) or on a pod with `hostNetwork` configuration.
*   Ability to open TCP connections to the BGP port (179) of target nodes.
*   Ability to send BGP messages.
*   Knowledge of BGP protocol and the Calico setup.
