We are able to perform UXSS using 302 redirect where iOS Firefox Focus allows to perform UXSS on any site you're visiting. We can reproduce this with Google search by visiting one of the malicious sites with PoC from the search results and that's just one of the examples how this could be used to exploit mass users.

PoC demo: <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php>

PoC: <?php header("Location: javascript:document.write(document.domain)", true, 302); ?>

This violates the standards even: there are a limited number of schemes browsers are supposed to accept as the destination of a 3XX Location header. `Javascript:` is definitely right out, but the spec has switched to a more conservative "allow-list" approach.

We should confirm this does not work on Firefox for iOS just in case, but I'm sure James would have reported it if that was broken also

I was wondering same thing and I found this report recently which is the reason why it doesn't work on iOS Firefox: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1588928>

It should be sec-critical even without this since identical impact report <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1588928> was assigned as sec-critical but we are also able to do silent background navigation opening <https://pwning.click/googleloc.php> and leave browser to open Focus from other browsers/apps like iOS Chrome with <a href="firefox-focus://open-url?url=[https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php">Open](https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php%22%3EOpen) with Firefox Focus</a> to achieve Full UXSS which is solid sec-critical.

James, what does this mean? You mean set a deeplink or is all of this happening from the same tab inside focus. Sorry but want to make sure I have the correct steps so we can implement a proper fix.

Reproduce step for this UXSS is <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860075#c11> but not <https://pwning.click/focuslink.php> which looks like a fix for <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1863831> and <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1863832>.

Hello, please note that Nish told me to test it with the following steps:

* Open Focus and go to google.com
* Background Focus
* Open Safari and then go to <https://pwning.click/focuslink.php>
* There will be a link in that safari page that when tapped opens Focus
* We make sure that no js is run on the page via deeplink

  I was not able to verify it with that link and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jNr5GnHf6jFN90fQNjeS7srRvJHQtKbN/view?usp=drive_link) is what happens.

Based on the last comment I tried to open it like you mentioned James above: `Please open https://google.com and go to https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php`

But no browser can open `https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php` - so even if I open google.com on Focus and then access that link to another browser to try and redirect to Focus, I can't do that, should I write that URL after I access google.com?

When I opened `https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php` over `google.com` the [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) text was displayed on a blank page and the URL was: pwning. click but the loading bar was stuck at the beginning (under URL bar). Like you see in the video above.

When I tap on the URL it shows what I pasted aka this one `https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php`.

Looking forward for a way to verify this issue.

That's wrong step and I never provided that :\ that's basically <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1863831> not this UXSS.

I clearly mentioned on <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860075#c8> it's <https://pwning.click/focus302link.php> not <https://pwning.click/focuslink.php> for other case, why did feedback stopped and fix for <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1863831> happened without notifying instead?

I have different bugs that were fixed by this patch which shouldn't happen if it was correct fix for this bug.

On this issue, you just verified it.

"When I opened <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php> over google.com the [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) text was displayed on a blank page and the URL was: pwning. click but the loading bar was stuck at the beginning (under URL bar). Like you see in the video above.

When I tap on the URL it shows what I pasted aka this one <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php>."

What you reproduced is javascript:document.write(document.domain) is running on <https://google.com> as I mentioned.

Thank you for highlighting these security issues. We acknowledge the complexity and importance of the bugs you've reported. To ensure our QA team can effectively test and address these concerns, we require more specific and detailed testing steps. We encountered difficulties with the current instructions, particularly with the link <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php> and your earlier steps.

Could you please provide a revised, clear set of steps for each bug, starting with this particular issue? Detailed instructions are essential for us to accurately replicate and resolve the problems.

Thanks for the reply, this was already reproduced by Andrei <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860075#c14> unintentionally and only step here is <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860075#c11>

To check this vulnerability, we must understand that we are checking document.write is executing with the context of <https://google.com> which will return [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) on blank page. I believe there was confusion on that part where checking JS URL running on address bar instead, which is not the correct way to verify in this case.

Thus, address bar is nothing to do here and it'll point to <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php> while 302 redirected JavaScript is running on <https://google.com> context.

<https://pwning.click/focuslink.php> is suppose to be a wrong link I pasted so I clarified that it should be <https://pwning.click/focus302link> but we were not able to communicate since then. So I can understand your perspective but I think it's better to talk each other if there was a problem on reproducing and ask to confirm if the wrong link <https://pwning.click/focuslink.php> is not the case and what should one follow before skipping that and proceeding the fix, which could be the wrong case like this one.

What you are explaining is fine but I want you to provide very clear steps in the next comment for our QA. I rather not have our QA dig into the thread chain to find correct steps. Hope you understand

There is multiple ways to reproduce this but since I mentioned several times on <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860075#c11>

1. Open <https://google.com> on Focus
2. Open <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php>

Expected behaviour: JavaScript doesn't run, we're staying on <https://google.com>

Actual behavior: blank page with [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) indicating that 302 redirected JavaScript on <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php> javascript:document.write(document.domain) was executed on <https://google.com> .

The link `https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php` doesn't appear to be working. Tried on multiple devices and it's not navigable.

That's weird, it works for me. Did you open <https://google.com> and then navigate to <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php> ?

It won't do anything and only display <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php> on address bar with javascript:document.write(document.domain) on target site.

What version of iOS, Safari, and Firefox Focus, are you testing with?

(Unfortunately I don't have an idevice so I can't test. Gecko refuses to handle the `javascript` URI in the location header at all - perhaps iOS webkit has started doing the same?)

This is what we mean by having clear STR (steps to reproduce) - if I follow the steps, I should be getting the issue which isn't the case right now as I would need to piece out what "do as Andrei" means. If the STR are not complete, then it leaves the door open for interpretation/miscommunication, and the bug not being fixed. Also as Nish and Gijs pointed out, it would also be very helpful to know which device and version you are testing on. Please ensure the STR are clear on all of your bug tickets. We love your contributions, but having complete STR and information on the bug at hand would make this much easier. Thank you.

|  | |

Hello, I've checked the comments from above a few times and I believe this will help to have something that puts everyone on the same page:

I tried to reproduce this issue on the latest Focus for iOS **v122 (17561)** with **iPhone 15 Pro (17.1.2).**

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open <https://google.com> on Focus.
2. As Focus has only one tab, tap on the URL and write **<https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php>**
3. Press enter in order to access **<https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php>**

### Expected Behavior

JavaScript doesn't run, we're staying on <https://google.com>

### Actual behavior

There is a blank page with [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) text, the URL is displayed as **pwning.click** and the loading page bar is stuck at 10%.

### Notes

Please note that with a refresh of the page (swipe down) the google.com is correctly displayed again.

Please note that there is no "indicating that 302 redirected JavaScript on <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php> javascript:document.write(document.domain) was executed on <https://google.com> ." as James Lee mentioned here.

(In reply to James Lee from [comment #22](/show_bug.cgi?id=1860075#c22 "RESOLVED FIXED - iOS Firefox Focus 302 redirect UXSS"))

> Actual behavior: blank page with [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) indicating that 302 redirected JavaScript on <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php> javascript:document.write(document.domain) was executed on <https://google.com> .

I prepared more videos:

* [Google Chrome](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18v5vw1ARCL3KXqad1wAgUYGNdq1oX4Vx/view?usp=sharing) - This site can't be reached error was displayed and on the URL was the following `javascript:document.write(document.domain)`
* [Firefox Focus v122 (17561)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1euLncn86rDDdY8UBOCh0Mn2_VFDI3s_t/view?usp=sharing) - There is a blank page with [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) text, the URL is displayed as **pwning.click** and the loading page bar is stuck at 10%.
* [Firefox for iOS v122 (37686)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YeG7pjpBfRlNYdaeXseNCs6g7HW2Jsl4/view?usp=sharing) - The `https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php` is instantly transformed into [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) and the loading bar is stuck at 10%, when clicking on the URL bar nothing happens as the google.com is correctly displayed.
* [Brave latest version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MfxIWWrkZKXLEjTWlDIln8z8hgvC5jIW/view?usp=sharing) - nothing happens the google.com is still displayed correctly.
* [Safari latest version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EQZiSEzyYIokjbY4GRRRbQcXrdsOrIeN/view?usp=sharing) - This site can't be reached error was displayed and on the URL was the following `javascript:document.write(document.domain)`

So based on the above information and what James commented above comments: Right now we are not returning javascript:document.write(document.domain) running on <https://google.com> but the URL `pwning.click` is displayed meaning that this issue is fixed.

But it's still weird (if you check the Focus video) how it's displayed.

Looking forward for some more information in order to verify this issue right.

No Safari, never said that, Focus browser on latest iOS is only prep and you guys are correctly reproducing but keep saying it's not working so I'm explaining same thing over and over. We need someone who can understand that [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) on blank page IS this UXSS vulnerabillity exploit working.

You are keep verifying that this vulnerabillity is not fixed, again. I already explained URL will display pwning.click and that's nothing to do with UXSS behaviour. Can someone come in here and verify that returning document.domain of [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) means you're UXSSing Focus and reproducing this report?

Did this way before I was asked, clear STR was always there, it's just that this issue has been misunderstood; URL is <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php> while blank page shows [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) . That IS this UXSS report. Hopefully I don't need to comment anymore here by someone finally confirm this with no problem.

I have added another patch for this in this [Focus PR](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-ios/pull/3989)

Once this gets merged and you have a build lets test against your steps. Instead of loading google or any site it should just stop after you visit <https://pwning.click/Focus302UXSS.php> (please only test on real device)

Thanks! I hope we can communicate better next time. I was going to decide to add other cases since no one seems to got around, with clicking on site info telling you javascript: URI is running on <https://google.com> but since this is understood and under the fix, I might add it sometime later for future reference and why this grants higher severity.

Title is iOS Firefox Focus 302 redirect UXSS and it's 0% related to deep link, it was that me pasting wrong link just once caused all this, my bad. (I couldn't delete it like chromium bugs since bugzilla doesn't support delete)

Already reproduced in here due to misunderstanding. (Let me know if you want to reproduce iOS Mail App version though)

<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1863832>

We just need to tap on cat to reproduce this.

Verified as fixed on v9000 (17565) with iPhone 15 Pro Max (17.1.2).

Here you can see the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SDb5Xu8j9zm_PMaQRKLuRUDqBkhVztYe/view?usp=sharing) made on the recent build and it can be seen that the JavaScript is not running and we remain on [www.google.com](http://www.google.com).

Hello, Nish and Laurie waiting for your confirmation, as I cannot check yet the bugs posted by James above in his last comment, but if we track those in there, then we can consider this issue done.

Are we fixing them in 122 as well with <https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-ios/pull/3973> ? they need to be checked before if that's the case.
