{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PrivateVPN for MacOS installs a privileged helper tool that runs as root and handles VPN connections via an XPC service. This helper tool executes the `openvpn` binary located in `/Applications/PrivateVPN.app/Contents/Resources` to establish new connections.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `openvpn` binary is located in a directory where a standard user can write to, allowing it to be overwritten with a malicious binary.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite the `openvpn` binary with a malicious one. When a new VPN connection is initiated, the privileged helper tool will execute this malicious binary, achieving arbitrary code execution as root.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with standard user privileges on the target MacOS system can overwrite the vulnerable openvpn binary.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have already achieved standard user privileges on the target machine in order to overwrite the openvpn binary and must be able to cause the privileged helper tool to execute the openvpn binary."
