Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is insecure file permissions set by the Remisol Advance software during installation. These permissions allow non-privileged users to modify or overwrite executable files and libraries associated with the Normand ViewerService.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the excessively permissive file system permissions granted to non-privileged users on the files belonging to the Normand ViewerService.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** By overwriting the service executable or its libraries, a low-privileged user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM/NT Authority privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation results in the attacker gaining full control of the system as the SYSTEM/NT Authority user, which is the highest privilege level on Windows.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute any code they choose with the aforementioned elevated privileges. This could lead to data theft, malware installation, denial of service or complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the target workstation.
*   **File System Manipulation:**  The attack requires the attacker to overwrite or manipulate the service's executable or its associated libraries.
*   **Service Restart:** Either a service restart or a system restart is needed to trigger execution of the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Level User Access:** The attacker needs to have low-level user access to the target Windows workstation.
*   **File System Write Permissions:** The attacker must be able to write to the directories containing the Remisol Advance Normand ViewerService executables and associated libraries.
*   **Ability to Trigger Restart:** The attacker needs to be able to restart the service or the entire system to have the modified executable run with SYSTEM privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text mentions that affected systems often have weak or default passwords which further facilitates initial access for exploitation.
*   The specific service and executable names may vary depending on region, so an attacker might need to investigate the installed services to locate the vulnerable components.
*   The fix mentioned is simple but important: correctly configuring file permissions to prevent non-privileged users from modifying the sensitive files.
