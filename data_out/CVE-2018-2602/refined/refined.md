Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2602:

**1. Verification:**

The provided text from Red Hat and Debian security advisories directly mention **CVE-2018-2602** and its root cause, which is related to the "loading of classes from untrusted locations" within the I18n (Internationalization) component of OpenJDK. This aligns with the official description of the vulnerability.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from the OpenJDK's I18n component using an untrusted search path when loading resource bundle classes.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is insecure class loading, allowing for the possibility of loading malicious class files from locations not intended for trusted sources.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Local Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code as another local user. This is achieved by forcing a vulnerable Java application to load a malicious class file controlled by the attacker.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local:** The vulnerability is triggered locally by manipulating the search paths used to load resource bundle classes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system.
    *   **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to have the ability to place malicious class files where they could be loaded by the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is explicitly within the I18n component of OpenJDK.
*   The exploit involves manipulating class loading mechanics related to resource bundles.
*   The impact includes "execution of arbitrary code as another local user."

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Red Hat advisory indicates this issue is rated as "Important".
*   The Red Hat advisory notes that this issue also affects java-1.7.1-ibm.
*   The Debian advisory mentions that this vulnerability is fixed in `openjdk-7` version `7u171-2.6.13-1~deb7u1` for Debian 7 "Wheezy".
*   The Debian advisory notes that this vulnerability is fixed in `openjdk-8` version `8u162-b12-1~deb9u1` for Debian 9 "Stretch".
*   The Ubuntu advisory for USN-3613-1 states this affects openjdk-8 and indicates that an attacker could use this to trick a user into running malicious code.
*   The Ubuntu advisory USN-3614-1 states this affects openjdk-7.

The information presented in the documents is consistent, providing a comprehensive view of the vulnerability.
