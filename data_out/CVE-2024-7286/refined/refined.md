Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `/admin/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint of the SourceCodester Establishment Billing Management System.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the username field, before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the system. The provided Proof of Concept (POC) shows how an attacker can log in as admin by injecting SQL code into the username field. This could lead to full compromise of the system, including data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to `/admin/ajax.php?action=login`. The attacker manipulates the username parameter in the request with SQL injection payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application endpoint. No special privileges are required, only network access to the system running the vulnerable application is necessary.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is the `username` field in the POST request to `/admin/ajax.php?action=login`.
*   The provided POC uses the payload `admin' or '1'='1` in the username field.
*   The SQL injection allows the attacker to bypass the authentication check by forcing the SQL query to always return true.

This information provides a good understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability in the SourceCodester Establishment Billing Management System version 1.0.
