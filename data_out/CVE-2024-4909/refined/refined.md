Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4909 (Note: The provided description for this CVE is a placeholder)

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `due_year` parameter within the `/view/student_due_payment.php` file of the "Complete Web-Based School Management System".

*   **Weakness:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`due_year` parameter) before using it in a SQL query, leading to SQL injection.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Sensitive user data or system data may be leaked.
    *   System security can be compromised.
    *   The environment is insecure, allowing malicious users to exploit the vulnerability.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is accessible via the HTTP request using the vulnerable parameter.
    *   Attackers can manipulate the `due_year` parameter by injecting SQL code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`/view/student_due_payment.php`).
    *   The attacker must be able to manipulate the `due_year` parameter.

* **Payload Example:** The provided payload is `due_year='%2B(select(0)from(select(sleep(12)))v)%2B'` which uses a time-based injection (sleep function) to confirm the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable software is "Campcodes Complete Web-Based School Management System" version 1.0 or lower.
*   The submission to VulDB was accepted, indicating that the vulnerability was verified.
*   The provided GitHub link contains a PDF that seems to further describe this vulnerability.
