- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory leak in the affected products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) due to the memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by performing multiple actions on certain web pages. This renders the affected products unavailable, requiring a power cycle to recover.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through network access by interacting with specific web pages of the affected products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web pages of the affected products. No specific privileges are mentioned, indicating that unauthenticated access might be sufficient.
