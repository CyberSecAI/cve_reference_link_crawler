Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a resource injection flaw. The application takes input from an upstream component and uses it as an identifier for a resource. The application fails to properly restrict or validate this input before using it, potentially allowing access to resources outside the intended scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Resource Injection:** The core vulnerability lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it to access a resource. This lack of input validation leads to the resource injection issue.
- **CWE-99:** This is the identified Common Weakness Enumeration which signifies "Improper Control of Resource Identifiers".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Exploitation can lead to unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive information.
- **Integrity:** Exploitation could allow the attacker to modify or corrupt data, possibly leading to system malfunction or data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/scas/classes/Users.php?f=save_user` endpoint.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The provided exploit code indicates the use of `multipart/form-data` to submit the malicious input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attack can be performed remotely.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic understanding of HTTP and HTML forms.**
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit does not show any authentication, implying that the attack can be carried out without prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0 of the School Club Application System.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
- The provided exploit manipulates the `firstname`, `middlename`, `lastname`, `username`, and `password` fields via an HTTP POST request. It's also apparent that the 'image' field is available. This may or may not be related to the vulnerability.
- The CVSS Meta Temp Score is 6.2, indicating a medium severity.
- The exploit price is estimated to be between $0 and $5k.
- The vulnerability was published on 04/09/2022.
