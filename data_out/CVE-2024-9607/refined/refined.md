  "CVE-2024-9607": {
    "description": "The 10Web Social Post Feed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note this is only exploitable when the leave a review notice is present.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the plugin's use of the `add_query_arg` function without proper escaping when constructing a URL. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into the URL.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious web scripts that will execute in a user's browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious site, or performing actions on the user's behalf.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a crafted link that contains the malicious payload within the query string parameters."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special privileges and can be unauthenticated. They need to be able to construct a malicious link and get a user to click it.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is specifically located in the `notices.php` file of the plugin, when a 'leave a review' notice is displayed. The vulnerable code is at line 92: `$query_str = ( isset( $admin_notices[$slug]['later_link'] ) ? $admin_notices[$slug]['later_link'] : esc_url(add_query_arg( $wd_options->prefix . '_admin_notice_ignore', $slug ) ) );`"
