{
  "CVE-2023-4578": {
    "root_cause": "When calling `JS::CheckRegExpSyntax`, a Syntax Error could be set, leading to a call to `convertToRuntimeErrorAndClear`. A memory allocation attempt within this function could fail due to out-of-memory conditions, causing a newly created Out of Memory exception to be incorrectly handled as a Syntax Error.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Out-of-memory condition not properly managed"
    ],
    "impact": "Mishandling of Out of Memory exception which could lead to an exploitable crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "By triggering the vulnerable code path by providing a regular expression with invalid syntax when memory is exhausted.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to cause memory exhaustion in the browser's process. Triggering the vulnerability requires interaction with the regular expression parsing functionality."
