Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Nextcloud Android app not properly removing sensitive data after a user account is deleted. Specifically, sensitive tokens, images, and other user-related details persist even after account deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Data Leakage:** Sensitive user data, including tokens and images, remains accessible after account deletion.
-   **Improper Authorization:** The system fails to completely remove user-specific data upon account deletion, implying that the removal process is incomplete or lacking proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information (tokens, images, user details) belonging to a deleted user account.
-   **Misuse of Information:** The leaked data could be misused for unauthorized activities or identity theft.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:** The attack vector is categorized as "Local," which implies that the attacker needs to have some level of access to the device where the Nextcloud Android app is installed. This could be physical access, or some form of access via another app or through a compromised device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker needs low privileges on the device to potentially access the residual data.
-   **User Interaction Required:** The exploit requires user interaction, though it is not clear what form of interaction. It could involve using the device or initiating the account deletion process.

**Additional Notes**

- The provided information references a fix in Nextcloud Android app version 3.19.0.
-   The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity with a CVSS score of 2.8.
