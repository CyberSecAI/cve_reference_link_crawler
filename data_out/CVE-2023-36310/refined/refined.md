Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-36310:

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `column` parameter of the Document Creator module when processing requests to `index.php`.

**Weakness:**
- The application directly reflects user-controlled input in the response without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's response. When a user visits the crafted URL, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the web page.
    - Perform other malicious actions within the user's browser context.

**Attack Vector:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript within the `column` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click on a malicious link containing the XSS payload or inject the link into a website the user will visit.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a request to `index.php` with the `column` parameter set to a malicious payload, such as `<scrIpt>alert(1);</scrIpt>`.
-  The provided content gives the following example: Replace the `action` parameter in a request to `index.php` value with `%3CscrIpt%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2FscRipt%3E`. It's indicated that this is an issue with the 'column' parameter, not 'action' which is reported to be vulnerable to a different XSS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided medium article details multiple vulnerabilities within PHPJabbers scripts, and CVE-2023-36310 is specific to reflected XSS in the `column` parameter of the Document Creator module.
- The vendor was unresponsive to the security team's communications.
