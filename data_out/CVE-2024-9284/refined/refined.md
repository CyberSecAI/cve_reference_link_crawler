  "CVE-2024-9284": {
    "description": "In the TL-WR841ND V11 Firmware has a stack overflow vulnerability in the ssid parameter of /userRpm/popupSiteSurveyRpm.htm url, which allows attackers to cause a DoS attack.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `stringModify` function. The function copies the user-provided 'ssid' parameter into a buffer (`v8`). The size of the `v8` buffer can be exceeded by the user-controlled input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. It is likely that a specially crafted input could also allow code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `/userRpm/popupSiteSurveyRpm.htm` with a long `ssid` parameter."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device. Authentication is required as a valid 'Authorization' header is passed in the request.",
      "additional_information": "The size of the `v53` variable, which is a buffer where the `ssid` is copied to after some modification, is 17 bytes while the input `ssid` is not validated for size. The function `stringModify` does not properly check the size of the input. This is where the overflow occurs. The provided PoC shows that a buffer with 0x55 '/%0A' repeated bytes, plus additional characters, is enough to trigger the vulnerability. "
