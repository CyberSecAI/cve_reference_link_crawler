Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-1811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `ResourceUploader` in the Publify application handles file uploads. Specifically, it was possible to bypass the intended content type restrictions by declaring an HTML file as "text/plain".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **MIME Type Mismatch Bypass:** The application was vulnerable to a MIME type mismatch bypass. Even if the user declared the file as text/plain, the system was able to detect the real MIME type. However, due to a vulnerability, it was not properly enforcing it for non-image files.
*   **Inadequate Content Type Validation:** The initial implementation did not properly validate the content type of uploaded files, particularly non-image files which only got validated through `file_content_type(new_file)`. This allowed attackers to upload HTML files disguised as text/plain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potential for Malicious HTML Injection:** By uploading an HTML file disguised as text/plain, an attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML content into the application.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability (Potential):**  If the application rendered the uploaded content without proper sanitization, this could lead to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** An attacker could upload a malicious HTML file through the resource upload functionality of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to File Upload Functionality:** The attacker needs to have access to the application's admin panel/functionality which allows uploading files.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious HTML:** The attacker must be capable of crafting a malicious HTML file.
*   **Understanding of MIME Type Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate file metadata to declare the malicious HTML as text/plain.

**Technical Details from the Commit:**

The commit `0fb6b027fbaf17f6a6551f2148482a03eac12927` addresses this vulnerability by:

*   **Adding a stricter `check_content_type!` method**: This method now checks the file's actual content type using `Marcel::MimeType.for` for all files, not just images.
*   **Adding a test case to prevent future regressions**: The test case checks if an html file, falsely identified as text/plain, is not uploaded.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `resource_uploader.rb` file.
*   The fix involves modifying the `check_content_type!` method and adding `file_content_type(new_file)` for files that are not images. This ensures that the content type is detected based on the file content itself and not just the user-provided metadata.
*   The `resources_controller_spec.rb` file was updated with a test case to explicitly check that HTML files uploaded as text/plain are rejected, preventing regressions.
