Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5507:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data within the parsing of KSP files. Specifically, the application does not adequately check the size of the data before copying it to a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The primary weakness is a buffer overflow occurring on the stack due to insufficient size checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running KeyShot Viewer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious KSP file: An attacker can craft a malicious KSP file with oversized data designed to trigger the buffer overflow when parsed by the application.
- Malicious web page:  The vulnerability can be triggered if a user opens a malicious file or visits a webpage that triggers the parsing of a specially crafted KSP file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.
- User interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability, requiring the user to open the malicious KSP file or visit a malicious page.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2023-12-11.
- A patch has been released by Luxion to address this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is tracked as ZDI-24-541 and ZDI-CAN-22266.
- The CVSS score is 7.8 with the vector string of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
