Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-2988:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability within the `SunGraphics2D` component of OpenJDK when performing bounds checks. This overflow occurs during calculations related to drawing operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the integer overflow, which bypasses intended bounds checks within the `SunGraphics2D` component. This specific weakness is located within the 2D graphics library of the JDK.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most significant impact of a successful exploit is a denial-of-service condition. This can manifest as excessive memory consumption, or an application crash.
- **Unspecified Impact**: The RedHat advisory for RHSA-2019:4109 does not specify further implications, but the other RHSA's mention a risk of arbitrary code execution as a result of similar vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Networked Attacks:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted input to an application that uses the affected graphics drawing functionality. This means the attack can come over a network and does not need to be local.
- **Data Injection:** Exploitation can occur through data supplied to APIs in the affected component. This could be done, for example, through specially crafted fonts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send malicious data to an application that uses the vulnerable `SunGraphics2D` component
- **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a special input such as a font to trigger the overflow condition.

**Summary**
The CVE-2019-2988 is due to an integer overflow within the SunGraphics2D library. Successful exploitation can result in a denial of service. Attackers can trigger this vulnerability over a network with carefully crafted malicious input.
