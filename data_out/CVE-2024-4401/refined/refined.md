Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-4401:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   - The Wordfence content explicitly states that the identified vulnerability is related to CVE-2024-4401.
   - The description from Wordfence directly matches that of the CVE, regarding stored XSS.
   - The vulnerable plugin versions and affected parameters are also consistent with the CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the lack of sufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the 'Elementor Addon Elements' plugin.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   -  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
   -  Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
   - The injected scripts execute whenever a user accesses the affected page.
   - This can lead to session hijacking, user redirection to malicious sites, defacement and other malicious actions that can compromise the integrity and safety of the website and its visitors.

**5. Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered through the  `id` and `eae_slider_animation` parameters.
    - Malicious scripts can be injected by modifying these parameters.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - Attackers must have authenticated access to the WordPress site.
   -  A Contributor level access or higher is required to inject the malicious scripts.

**Additional Technical Details (From the provided content):**
   - The vulnerability exists in `modules/animated-text/widgets/animated-text.php` and `modules/bg-slider/module.php`
   - The vulnerable code locations involve using the values of parameters directly without proper escaping or sanitization.
     -  `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` source code snippet displays the usage of  `$this->get_id()` and `esc_js()` in `modules/bg-slider/module.php`, it seems that while escaping is introduced it's still vulnerable without proper sanitization.
   - Code changes in `classes/helper.php` show that the fix uses `esc_url()` for image URLs and `esc_attr()` for text in `Helper::get_icon_html()` function. Also `Helper::eae_wp_kses()` is introduced to sanitize html in `Helper::get_icon_html()` which is likely the fix
  -  `elementor-addon-elements.php` indicates version 1.13.6 as the patched version and the changelog of `readme.txt` also mentions the fix.
