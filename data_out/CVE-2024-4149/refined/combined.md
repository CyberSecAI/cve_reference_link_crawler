## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Floating Chat Widget < 3.2.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go "Chaty > Create New Widgets
3. Intercept the widget's edit request and save it.
4. Put the payload in the \*\*cht\_social\_Phone[contact\_form\_title\_bg\_color]\*\* parameter
"><script></script><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>

### Affects Plugins
