| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Xtended Services Platform Authentication Bypass Vulnerability Critical   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-bw-auth-bypass-kCggMWhX  First Published: 2023 September 6 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwh02758](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh02758)     CVE-2023-20238     CWE-287       CVSS Score: [Base 10.0](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2023-20238     CWE-287       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bw-auth-bypass-kCggMWhX/csaf/cisco-sa-bw-auth-bypass-kCggMWhX.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the single sign-on (SSO) implementation of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Cisco BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to forge the credentials required to access an affected system.  This vulnerability is due to the method used to validate SSO tokens. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application with forged credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to commit toll fraud or to execute commands at the privilege level of the forged account. If that account is an *Administrator* account, the attacker would have the ability to view confidential information, modify customer settings, or modify settings for other users. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need a valid user ID that is associated with an affected Cisco BroadWorks system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bw-auth-bypass-kCggMWhX>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Cisco BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco BroadWorks and have one of the following applications enabled:    + AuthenticationService   + BWCallCenter   + BWReceptionist   + CustomMediaFilesRetrieval   + ModeratorClientApp   + PublicECLQuery   + PublicReporting   + UCAPI   + Xsi-Actions   + Xsi-Events   + Xsi-MMTel   + Xsi-VTR For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + BroadWorks Ansible Playbook   + BroadWorks Database Server   + BroadWorks Database Troubleshooting Server   + BroadWorks Execution Server   + BroadWorks Media Server   + BroadWorks Messaging Server   + BroadWorks Network Database Server   + BroadWorks Network Function Manager   + BroadWorks Network Server   + BroadWorks Pre-Install Check   + BroadWorks Profile Server   + BroadWorks Service Control Function Server   + BroadWorks Service License Report Tool   + BroadWorks Sharing Server   + BroadWorks Software Manager   + BroadWorks Video Server   + BroadWorks WebRTC Server  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
