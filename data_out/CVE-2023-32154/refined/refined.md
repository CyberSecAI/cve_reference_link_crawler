- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the Router Advertisement Daemon (RADVD), leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of root, allowing a complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can trigger the vulnerability without requiring authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable Mikrotik RouterOS device. No authentication is required.
