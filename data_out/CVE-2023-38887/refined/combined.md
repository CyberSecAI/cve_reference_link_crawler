## One **web suite** to manage all of your **business**...

## An all-in-one suite

![Dolibarr, easy to use ERP and CRM software for businesses](/medias/image/www.dolibarr.org/images/dolibarr_box.webp)

• **Enable only the features that you want**: Whatever your needs are (Customer Relationship Management, Sales, Human Resources, Logistics, Stock, Invoicing, Accounting, Manufacturing, Marketing, Foundation Management, Surveys, ...), you can setup the application to match your needs... [See Features](#features)
• **No more double entries**: Integration between the features/modules is ready and "in-the-box". Users are immediately able to work with the software, even without customisation.
• **Upgrade at any time**: The upgrades of new versions are integrated by design into the development process. So, you can upgrade Dolibarr at any time to the latest version, irrespective of which Dolibarr version you are using, and without losing any data. Thus, users always benefit from the latest features and innovations.
• **A customisable and extensible application**: The **marketplace** is open to everybody and serves as a central repository for hundreds of external add-ons which enhance Dolibarr for specific needs.
You can also extend and enhance the features of your application by yourself, without any coding or development effort, by using the **low-code** Module Builder assistant. If the Module Builder does not offer all the customisation that you need, then you can take the route of custom development to achieve your business goals.

## A FOSS (Free Open Source Software) model

• **A more competitive solution**: Due to our **Free Open Source Software** model, several thousands of developers, testers, translators, and end users work on the Dolibarr project.That's why Dolibarr is always at the forefront of innovation.
• **The easiest ERP and CRM** system in the market: The Open Source model allows developers and users to enhance the user interface due to the constant feedback and contributions of the Dolibarr user community.
Everybody can contribute to enhance the Dolibarr application. This is an important factor that defines why Dolibarr became so user-friendly. [See Community section](#community)

## A multi-distribution model - On-premise or in the Cloud

• **Install the Dolibarr application where ever you want**: You can install and use Dolibarr **as a local application** or **online** on a dedicated/virtual machine. You can thus use Dolibarr **from anywhere and on any device**.
• **Available on all platforms**, **on-premise** or as a **SaaS application**: Dolibarr is available in various forms: From **auto-installer packages** that install Dolibarr and all prerequisites with no need of any technical knowledge, or from the **standard distribution** working on all Operating System platforms and PHP architectures (Windows, Mac, Linux).
Dolibarr is also available as a **SaaS application**. [See Cloud offers](https://saas.dolibarr.org)

• **A rich ecosystem of partners**: Because Dolibarr is Open Source software, you can rely on any Open Source company to assist you or to engage in custom development if you need it.

Akerva – Security advisory – Dolibarr – Arbitrary File Upload
(Authenticated) CVE-2023-38887

TECHNICAL DETAILS

Vulnerability Details

One of the pre-installed modules in Dolibarr is “DMS/ECM”, which in summary, lets the
users to manage their documents in an automatic or manual way.

FIGURE 1: ECM AUTOMATIC TREE VIEW.

In order to avoid an Arbitrary File Upload which sometimes can lead to Arbitrary
Command Execution, the application is going to append “.noexe” extension at the end of
any file having a “dangerous” extension.

Akerva – Security advisory – Dolibarr – Arbitrary File Upload
(Authenticated) CVE-2023-38887

The code responsible for this behavior is the following, which basically before writing the
file to the disk, checks if the original file extension matches with one of the blacklisted
ones:

FIGURE 3: PART OF DOL_MOVE_UPLOADED_FILE (HTDOCS/CORE/LIB/FILES.LIB.PHP).

FIGURE 4: ISAFILEWITHEXECUTABLECONTENT FUNCTION
(HTDOCS/CORE/LIB/FUUNCTIONS.LIB.PHP).

Another Dolibarr pre-installed module is “API / WEB SERVICES” which enables a REST
server and lets the users do all kinds of actions through API calls. One of these actions is
the document upload and after analyzing the related class
(htdocs/api/class/api_documents.class.php), it was noticed that excepting some
sanitizations, no security measures to prevent arbitrary file upload were present.

Akerva – Security advisory – Dolibarr – Arbitrary File Upload
(Authenticated) CVE-2023-38887

Proof of Concept (PoC)

Let’s assume that both REST API and DMS/ECM modules are enabled in Dolibarr and we
have an account which has the permission of submitting data using DMS/ECM module.
We just need to get the API key linked to our account and send an authenticated API
request containing our malicious file as shown below:

FIGURE 5: ARBITRARY FILE UPLOAD STEPS.

In case of Dolibarr environment is not correctly configured and “documents” directory is
exposed by the web server, we can reach the uploaded files which means execute a
webshell:

FIGURE 6: WEBSHELL EXECUTION.

Another risk is being able to upload malicious executable files that could compromise
user security.
