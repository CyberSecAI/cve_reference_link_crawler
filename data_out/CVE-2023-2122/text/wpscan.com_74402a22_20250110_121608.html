## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Image Optimizer by 10web < 1.0.27 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the iowd\_tabs\_active parameter before rendering it in the plugin admin panel, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability, allowing an attacker to trick a logged in admin to execute arbitrary javascript by clicking a link.

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=iowd\_settings&msg=1&iowd\_tabs\_active=generalry8uo%22%3e%3cimg%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert(1)%3ef0cmo
