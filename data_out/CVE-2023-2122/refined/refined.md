{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `iowd_tabs_active` parameter before rendering it in the plugin admin panel.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into executing arbitrary JavaScript by clicking a malicious link.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious `iowd_tabs_active` parameter and tricks a logged-in administrator to access it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a logged-in administrator to click on it. No authentication is required, but the target must be logged in as an admin."
