- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing bounds check in `camsys`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local information disclosure. An attacker with system execution privileges could read sensitive information from memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Local. An attacker would need to be able to execute code on the target device with System privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** System execution privileges are required for exploitation. No user interaction is required.
