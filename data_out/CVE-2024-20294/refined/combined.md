This vulnerability is due to improper handling of specific fields in an LLDP frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to an interface of an affected device and having an authenticated user retrieve LLDP statistics from the affected device through CLI **show** commands or Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the LLDP service to crash and stop running on the affected device. In certain situations, the LLDP crash may result in a reload of the affected device.  **Note:** LLDP is a Layer 2 link protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be directly connected to an interface of an affected device, either physically or logically (for example, through a Layer 2 Tunnel configured to transport the LLDP protocol).  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-lldp-dos-z7PncTgt>  This advisory is part of the February 2024 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco FXOS or NX-OS Software and had the LLDP feature enabled globally and on at least one interface:    + Firepower 4100 Series ([CSCwi29934](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi29934))   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances ([CSCwi29934](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi29934))   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches ([CSCwf67408](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf67408))   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches ([CSCwe86457](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe86457))   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches ([CSCwf67411](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf67411))   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches ([CSCwf67411](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf67411))   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches ([CSCwf67411](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf67411))   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches ([CSCwf67409](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf67409))   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode ([CSCwi31871](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi31871))   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode ([CSCwe86457](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe86457))   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCwf67412](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf67412))   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCwf67412](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf67412))   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCwf67468](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf67468))   + UCS 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCwf67468](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf67468)) For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the Status of LLDP for Cisco FXOS Software The LLDP feature is enabled by default on Cisco FXOS software and cannot be fully disabled. LLDP is always enabled on the management interface (mgmt0) and on internal backplane ports that connect to the blades. All other interfaces have LLDP disabled by default, with the option to enable it through a network control policy. Additional information is available in the *Configure a Network Control Policy* section of the [Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS Firepower Chassis Manager Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/2111/web-guide/b_GUI_FXOS_ConfigGuide_2111/platform_settings.html#task_b34_z2g_3gb).  To determine the status of LLDP on a specific interface, use the **connect fxos** command at the device CLI, then use the **show lldp interface ethernet** *module/interface*command. If the **enable** (**rx**) status is set to **Y**, the interface accepts incoming LLDP packets, as shown in the following example:  ```   FPR# show lldp interface ethernet 1/1Interface Information:  Enable (tx/rx/dcbx): Y/Y/Y    Port Mac address: 00:fc:ba:05:04:94   ``` Determine the Status of LLDP on Cisco MDS and Nexus Switches That Are Running Cisco NX-OS Software The LLDP feature is disabled by default on Cisco MDS or Nexus Switches that are running Cisco NX-OS Software. To determine if the LLDP feature has been enabled, use the **show feature | include lldp** command at the device CLI. The following example shows that the LLDP feature is enabled:  ```   switch# show feature | include lldplldp                   1          enabled    ```  If the LLDP feature has been enabled, LLDP is also enabled on all interfaces by default. Processing of incoming LLDP packets can be selectively disabled on a specific interface by using the **no lldp receive** interface-level configuration command.  To determine the status of LLDP on a specific interface, use the **show lldp interface ethernet** *module/interface* command at the device CLI. If the **enable** (**rx**) status is set to **Y**, the interface accepts incoming LLDP packets, as shown in the following example:  ```   switch# show lldp interface ethernet 1/1Interface Information:  Enable (tx/rx/dcbx): Y/Y/Y    Port Mac address: 00:a6:ca:b6:84:5a   ``` Determine the Status of LLDP on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode The LLDP feature is enabled by default on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode and cannot be fully disabled. LLDP is enabled by default on all fabric ports and access ports.  Processing of incoming LLDP packets can be selectively disabled on a specific access port by using the **no lldp receive** interface-level configuration command from the APIC NX-OS style CLI, or by having LLDP disabled in the applied access policy. Additional information is available in the *Access Policies Overview* section of the [Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure Fundamentals Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/6x/aci-fundamentals/cisco-aci-fundamentals-60x/provisioning-60x.html#concept_0F4DAC4EB5344665BE50B19F6B04FB02).  To determine the status of LLDP on a specific interface, use the **show lldp interface ethernet** *module/interface*command at the device CLI. If the **enable** (**rx**) status is set to **Y**, the interface accepts incoming LLDP packets, as shown in the following example:  ```   switch# show lldp interface ethernet 1/1Interface Information:  Enable (tx/rx/dcbx): Y/Y/N    Port Mac address: 50:87:89:a2:10:39   ``` Determine the Status of LLDP on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects The LLDP feature is enabled by default on Cisco UCS 6200, 6300, 6400, and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects and cannot be fully disabled. LLDP is always enabled on the following interfaces:    + Ethernet uplink ports (network interfaces that connect to upstream switches for network connectivity)   + Ethernet port channel members   + Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) uplink ports   + Management interface (mgmt0) LLDP may also be enabled on server ports (interfaces that are presented to the servers in the Cisco UCS Manager domain) and appliance ports (interfaces that connect to directly attached NFS storage) through a network control policy. Additional information is available in the *Configuring Network Control Policies* section of the [Cisco UCS Manager Network Management Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/ucs-manager/GUI-User-Guides/Network-Mgmt/4-3/b_UCSM_Network_Mgmt_Guide_4_3/b_UCSM_Network_Mgmt_Guide_chapter_01010.html#d20481e10246a1635).  To determine the status of LLDP on a specific interface, use the **connect nxos** command at the device CLI, then use the **show lldp interface ethernet** *module/interface*command. If the **enable** (**rx**) status is set to **Y**, the interface accepts incoming LLDP packets, as shown in the following example:  ```   FI-A# show lldp interface ethernet 1/1/1Interface Information:  Enable (tx/rx/dcbx): Y/Y/Y    Port Mac address: 00:c8:8b:84:a2:54   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Secure Firewall 3100 Series   + Secure Firewall 4200 Series  Details  * Exploitation of this vulnerability may cause the LLDP service to crash repeatedly and to generate one or more core files on the affected device. The repeated crashes may result either in the LLDP service no longer running on the affected device or in an overall reload of the device.  If the LLDP service stops running on the affected device, execution of any **show lldp** command at the device CLI will result in **service not enabled** output, as shown in the following example:  ```   switch# show lldp trafficService not enabled   ```  In this situation, a reload of the affected device is required to restart the LLDP service.
