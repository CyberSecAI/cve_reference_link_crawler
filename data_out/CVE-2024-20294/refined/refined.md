- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of specific fields in an LLDP frame.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way Cisco FXOS and NX-OS software process LLDP packets, specifically crafted packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, leading to the LLDP service crashing. In some cases, repeated crashes can cause the affected device to reload. The LLDP service will no longer function, and a device reload is necessary to restore it.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted LLDP packet to an interface of an affected device. This requires the attacker to be directly connected to an interface of the device, either physically or logically (e.g., via a Layer 2 Tunnel).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be adjacent to the targeted device (i.e., directly connected) either physically or logically, and able to send LLDP packets. They also need an authenticated user to retrieve LLDP statistics using CLI or SNMP.
