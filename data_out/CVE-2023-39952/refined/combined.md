# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### Description

Using advanced permissions. When copying-pasting a Group folder via the web interface to another folder, the permissions are not respected, where a user without read access to certain subfolders can download the entire Group folder with all data.

Example, a user may have the following permissions:

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a group folder with a user with default read only access for a user. Create additional subfolders and assign a user advanced permissions as follows.

   Group folder (read-only)

   |--- Folder 1 (read-only)

   |--- Folder 2 (**no access**)

   |--- Folder 3 (full access)
2. When a user views the Group folder via the web, the following will appear:

Group folder (read-only)

|--- Folder 1 (read-only)

|--- Folder 3 (full access)

Example - view of the user:

[![1  User's View of the Group Folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78890482/155660042-b85d1056-752c-43c4-b8eb-3b5de0f9cef8.PNG)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78890482/155660042-b85d1056-752c-43c4-b8eb-3b5de0f9cef8.PNG)

3. When a user clicks download the Group folder, the folders as above in (2) will be downloaded. 👍
4. When a user clicks "copy" the entire Group folder via the web interface and saves the folder to another destination, the following occurs ❌

### Expected behaviour

Only the following folders are copied:

Group folder (read-only)

|--- Folder 1 (read-only)

|--- Folder 3 (full access)

### Actual behaviour

All the folders/files of the entire group folder are copied

Group folder (read-only)

|--- Folder 1 (read-only)

|--- Folder 2 (**no access**)

|--- Folder 3 (full access)

Example - all group subfolders & contents are copied files to the user's target folder:
