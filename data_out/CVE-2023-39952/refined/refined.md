Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-39952:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Nextcloud handles advanced permissions when copying entire group folders. Specifically, when a user copies a group folder, the system does not correctly enforce the advanced permissions set on subfolders within that group folder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly check and enforce advanced permissions when a group folder is copied via the web interface. This allows users to bypass access restrictions.
- **Inconsistent Permission Handling:**  While the web interface correctly reflects a user's access level when browsing a group folder, this information is not honored during copy operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** A user with limited access to a group folder can gain access to files in subfolders that they should not have access to. This is a confidentiality issue.
- **Data Breach Risk:** This vulnerability could lead to sensitive data being exposed to unauthorized users, potentially resulting in a data breach.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is the Nextcloud web interface where the copy operation is initiated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid user within the Nextcloud instance, with some level of access to the group folder.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the copy functionality within the Nextcloud web interface.
- **No special privileges are required**. The vulnerability can be triggered by a user with low privileges, as long as they have some level of access to the group folder.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to affect a range of Nextcloud server versions, including versions from 22.x to 27.x.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves ensuring that the system respects advanced permission settings during the copy process.
- The issue was tracked on GitHub under issue #1906 in the nextcloud/groupfolders repository and fixed with a pull request #38890 to the nextcloud/server repository.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided GitHub pull request #38890, titled "use source cache when listing folder during recursive copy", is related to fixing this vulnerability. It appears to involve changes in how the server handles recursive operations like copying folders to improve performance and also fix access control issues.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.5, categorized as "Moderate" severity, with High confidentiality impact, but no impact on integrity and availability. The attack vector is Network based, with low complexity, and low privileges are required.
- The weakness was classified as CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
