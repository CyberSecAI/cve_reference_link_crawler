### Description

Using advanced permissions. When copying-pasting a Group folder via the web interface to another folder, the permissions are not respected, where a user without read access to certain subfolders can download the entire Group folder with all data.

Example, a user may have the following permissions:

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a group folder with a user with default read only access for a user. Create additional subfolders and assign a user advanced permissions as follows.

   Group folder (read-only)

   |--- Folder 1 (read-only)

   |--- Folder 2 (**no access**)

   |--- Folder 3 (full access)
2. When a user views the Group folder via the web, the following will appear:

Group folder (read-only)

|--- Folder 1 (read-only)

|--- Folder 3 (full access)

Example - view of the user:

[![1  User's View of the Group Folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78890482/155660042-b85d1056-752c-43c4-b8eb-3b5de0f9cef8.PNG)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78890482/155660042-b85d1056-752c-43c4-b8eb-3b5de0f9cef8.PNG)

3. When a user clicks download the Group folder, the folders as above in (2) will be downloaded. üëç
4. When a user clicks "copy" the entire Group folder via the web interface and saves the folder to another destination, the following occurs ‚ùå

### Expected behaviour

Only the following folders are copied:

Group folder (read-only)

|--- Folder 1 (read-only)

|--- Folder 3 (full access)

### Actual behaviour

All the folders/files of the entire group folder are copied

Group folder (read-only)

|--- Folder 1 (read-only)

|--- Folder 2 (**no access**)

|--- Folder 3 (full access)

Example - all group subfolders & contents are copied files to the user's target folder:
