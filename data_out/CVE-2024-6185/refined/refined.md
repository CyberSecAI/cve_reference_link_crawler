Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of user-supplied input in the `get_ip_addr_details` function within the `/view/dhcp/dhcpConfig/commit.php` file of Ruijie RG-UAC 1.0. Specifically, the `ethname` argument is not properly sanitized, allowing for OS command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application constructs an OS command using the `ethname` argument without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the OS.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the input provided for the `ethname` parameter, leading to the command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, making it accessible to attackers over a network.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the `ethname` parameter in an HTTP request to inject malicious OS commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the vulnerable Ruijie RG-UAC device.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Attackers need to be able to craft or modify HTTP requests to include malicious commands in the `ethname` parameter.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not seem to require prior authentication to be exploited.

**Additional Information:**
- **Public Exploit:** A public exploit is available, making exploitation easier.
- **Proof of Concept:** The exploit is available as a proof-of-concept.
- **Vendor Non-Response:** The vendor was contacted about the vulnerability but did not respond.
- **Google Hacking:** The vulnerability can be found using Google Hacking with the search term `inurl:view/dhcp/dhcpConfig/commit.php`.
