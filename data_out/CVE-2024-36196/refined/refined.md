This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). CVE-2024-36196 is one of the listed vulnerabilities.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is classified as Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). This means that malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the application's data, and later executed when a user views the affected content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can inject the malicious script through the application's interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low privileged attacker (PR:L) is needed, and a user interaction (UI:R) is required. The scope is changed (S:C) meaning the vulnerable component is different from the impacted component.
