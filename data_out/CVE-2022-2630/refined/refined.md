The provided content describes a vulnerability related to CVE-2022-2630.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the improper rendering of GitLab Flavored Markdown (GFM) references within Incident Timeline Events. Specifically, the `TimelineEventPipeline` uses `Banzai::Pipeline::GfmPipeline.reference_filters` which expands GFM references in the timeline event descriptions. This expansion does not apply the usual redaction logic used when rendering private/confidential resources to non-permissioned users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control when rendering GFM references in Incident Timeline Events.
- Failure to redact private/confidential resource titles when rendering timeline event descriptions for users who lack permission to access those resources.
- Inclusion of `Banzai::Pipeline::GfmPipeline.reference_filters` in the `TimelineEventPipeline` without proper consideration for access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of titles for private/confidential resources (e.g., issues, merge requests) to unauthorized users.
- Information disclosure vulnerability, where an attacker can potentially learn about sensitive information by crafting GFM references to private resources.
- Attackers can iterate through issue numbers of a project to leak titles of private/confidential issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker creates an incident and adds a timeline event which references confidential resources using GFM references within the description.
- The attacker views the timeline to see if confidential resources' titles are rendered, and if so, this can be used to gather information.
- An attacker can iterate through numerical references (e.g., issue #1, issue #2, etc.) to find private or confidential resources and leak their titles.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user in a project where they can create incidents and timeline events, to be able to input a GFM reference.
- No special permissions are required beyond those of a normal user capable of creating incidents.
