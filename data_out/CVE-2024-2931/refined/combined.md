### Description

The WPFront User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.1.11184 via the wpfront\_user\_role\_editor\_assign\_roles\_user\_autocomplete AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to extract retrieve a list of all user email addresses who are registered on the site.
