The provided content is related to CVE-2023-41445.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `AjaxNewsTicker` component of phpkobo, specifically when processing the `cmd` parameter within the `index.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in `AjaxNewsTicker` version 1.05. The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser by crafting a malicious payload. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker crafts a malicious link containing a payload in the `cmd` parameter and sends it to the victim. When the victim clicks on the link, the malicious code embedded in the URL executes on the user's browser. The payload is embedded in the `requ` parameter which is sent via a GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker can be remote. The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload and trick a victim into clicking the crafted URL.
