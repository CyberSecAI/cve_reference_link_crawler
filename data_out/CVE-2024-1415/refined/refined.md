### CVE-2024-1415

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in several functions of the Responsive Contact Form Builder & Lead Generation Plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to insufficient nonce validation in multiple functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated attacker can invoke vulnerable functions by tricking a site administrator into performing an action like clicking a link. This can lead to form deletion, lead signup, and file uploads.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted request that exploits the lack of nonce validation. The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing an action that triggers the forged request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious link or request and social engineer a logged-in administrator to interact with it. The attacker does not need any authentication to the WordPress instance.
