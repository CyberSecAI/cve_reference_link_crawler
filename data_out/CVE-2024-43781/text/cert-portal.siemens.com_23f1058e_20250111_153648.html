SSA-097786: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File Vulnerability in SINUMERIK systems

| Publication Date: | 2024-09-10 |

SUMMARY

SINUMERIK systems, that have been provisioned with Create MyConfig (CMC), are affected by a Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability. When using a CMC package on a NCU or on an IPC the password used in the CMC package or typed in manually during package execution is traced on the machine to the file `uptrace.out`. This could allow a local authenticated user with low privileges to read that password and use it to impersonate a user with higher privileges.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* CVE-2024-43781:

  Delete the file(s) manually (after using CMC):

  + on an NCU: `/card/user/sinumerik/hmi/log/sltrc/uptrace.out`
  + on an IPC: `c:\ProgramData\Siemens\MotionControl\user\sinumerik\hmi\log\sltrc\uptrace.out`

  and the corresponding backup of the tracefile, `uptrace.out.bak`.

  Replace trace configuration to switch off trace for the future.

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).
