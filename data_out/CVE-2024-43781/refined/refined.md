- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When using a Create MyConfig (CMC) package on a SINUMERIK NCU or IPC, the password used in the CMC package, or typed manually during package execution, is traced and logged to the `uptrace.out` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insertion of sensitive information (passwords) into log files (CWE-532).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local authenticated user with low privileges can read the logged password, potentially enabling them to impersonate a user with higher privileges. This could lead to unauthorized access and control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low-level authenticated access to the system where the `uptrace.out` log file is located. They need to be able to access and read files on the system.
