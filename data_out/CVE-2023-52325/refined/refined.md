Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2023-52325:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data before it is passed to a PHP `include` function within the `getObjWGFServiceApiByApiName` function of a Trend Micro Apex Central widget.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The vulnerability is a local file inclusion flaw, which means an attacker can potentially include arbitrary local files by manipulating the input to the vulnerable `include` function. This can be leveraged to gain access to sensitive files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting this LFI vulnerability, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected Trend Micro Apex Central installations. The code execution context is that of the IUSR account.
- **Full Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, including data breaches, system manipulation, and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, over the network.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the Trend Micro Apex Central system.
- **Chaining Required:** The vulnerability must be used in conjunction with another (unspecified) vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system to remotely exploit the vulnerability.
- **Valid Credentials:** The attacker must first possess valid user credentials for the Trend Micro Apex Central system.
- **Chaining:** The attacker must be able to exploit an additional, unspecified vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.
