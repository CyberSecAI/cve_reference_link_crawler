*Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.*
### Mitigating Factors

Exploiting these type of vulnerabilities generally require that an attacker has access (physical or remote) to a vulnerable machine. In addition to timely application of patches and updated solutions, customers are also advised to review remote access to critical systems and ensure policies and perimeter security is up-to-date.
