{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the ActivityManagerService.sendIntentSender when a non-PendingIntent target is used, and a non-null whitelistToken is sent to the client. This was due to the whitelistToken not being removed when sending to a non-PendingIntent.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of whitelistToken when sending non-PendingIntent targets in ActivityManagerService.sendIntentSender.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local escalation of privilege.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a non-PendingIntent target with a non-null whitelistToken.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the device."
