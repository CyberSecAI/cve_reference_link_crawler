Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and escaping of the `tba_service_id` parameter before it's used in a SQL query. This happens within an AJAX action in the `truebooker-service-price.php` file of the TrueBooker plugin, making it accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The AJAX action vulnerable to SQLi is accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially use SQLi to extract sensitive information from the database or modify its content.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, SQLi can lead to more severe consequences, such as arbitrary code execution on the server, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
*   The CVSS score is 8.6 (high), with high confidentiality impact and no integrity or availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to the `truebooker-service-price.php` file.
*   **`tba_service_id` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `tba_service_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No authentication:** The attacker does not need to have any user account on the WordPress site.
*   **Network access:** Requires network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** Attacker needs to know that the `tba_service_id` parameter is vulnerable.
*  **Ability to send a crafted HTTP POST request**

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `truebooker-appointment-booking` plugin, specifically in versions prior to 1.0.3, which fixed the issue.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses the `SLEEP(5)` function to demonstrate the injection, but more harmful SQLi payloads could be used.

This information is consistent with the CVE description, which indicates a SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to lack of parameter sanitization, accessible to unauthenticated users. The provided content includes a detailed PoC and impact, therefore this is not NOINFO.
