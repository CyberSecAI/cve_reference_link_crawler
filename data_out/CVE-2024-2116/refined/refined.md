    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious script and trick a user into clicking it. No authentication or special permissions are needed, meaning any unauthenticated user can try to exploit this vulnerability. A social engineering attack is needed to trick a user into clicking the malicious link."
