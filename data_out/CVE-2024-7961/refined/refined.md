- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, leading to path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A threat actor could upload arbitrary files to the server, potentially resulting in remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H).
