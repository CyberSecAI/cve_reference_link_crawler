In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Correct the defined value for AMDGPU_DMUB_NOTIFICATION_MAX

[Why & How]
It actually exposes '6' types in enum dmub_notification_type. Not 5. Using smaller
number to create array dmub_callback & dmub_thread_offload has potential to access
item out of array bound. Fix it.
