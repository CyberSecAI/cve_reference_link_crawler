[@sebhildebrandt](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt) I've been looking into the SSID related vulnerability and I would just like to mention a tiny optimisation detail.

The loop in question -

```
for (let i = 0; i <= util.mathMin(t.length, 2000); i++)
```

- will rerun `util.mathMin` on each loop iteration, so in cases as such it is best assigning the function's result to a variable once instead of rerunning it everywhere.

Just a slight optimisation advice, won't make much difference, but who knows.

Not a huge change worth a fork & pull, so just leaving the message here.

Sorry, something went wrong.

[@4S1ght](https://github.com/4S1ght) you are right! I normally try to avoid this but it seems have not seen ... actually I found 14 places, where I have not seen this ;-)
