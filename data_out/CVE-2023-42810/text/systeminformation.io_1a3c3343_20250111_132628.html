Security Advisories
## SSID Command Injection Vulnerability

Affected versions:
< 5.23.7

Date: 2024-11-11

CVE indentifier CVE-2024-56334

#### Impact

We had an issue that there was a possibility to perform a potential command injection possibility by crafting detected SSIDs in networkInterfaces() on windows machines.

#### Patch

Problem was fixed with parameter checking. If you are using version 5, please upgrade to version >= 5.23.7.

## Passing User Paramters to Systeminformation

For most of the applications that are using systeminformation, there is no reason to worry. But be aware! If you are using inetLatency(), inetChecksite(), services(), processLoad(), versions() with arbitrary untrusted user input, you should pay extra attention! We are doing a lot of input sanitation for those functions inside this package but we cannot handle all cases!

This can lead to serious impact on your servers!

We highly recommend to always upgrade to the latest version of our package. We maintain security updates for version 5 AND also version 4. For version 4 you can install latest version by placing "systeminformation": "^4" in your package.json (dependencies) and run npm install
