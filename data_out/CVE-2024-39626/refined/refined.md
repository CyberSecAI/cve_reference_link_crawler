Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The Pretty Simple Popup Builder WordPress plugin, versions 1.0.9 and earlier, is vulnerable to XSS. This likely arises from unsanitized user-supplied input being included in the plugin's output.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of input sanitization: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided data before rendering it on the page. This allows malicious scripts to be injected.

**Impact:**
*   A malicious actor can inject arbitrary scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website.
*   When a user visits the site, these malicious scripts execute within the user's browser.
*  This can lead to various issues like session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker would likely inject malicious scripts through an input field or some other user-controlled parameter within the plugin's functionality.
*   The injected script would then be stored and executed within the context of the affected website when a user interacts with the vulnerable feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate input that is processed by the plugin.  
*   The provided content states that administrator privileges are required but this should be verified via the official CVE description.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "low" priority by Patchstack.
*   The CVSS score is 5.9, which is considered a medium severity.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.0.10 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability falls under OWASP Top 10 A3: Injection.
