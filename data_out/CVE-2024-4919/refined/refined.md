Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input (`course_name` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or the use of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization. Specifically, the `course_name` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify data within the database.
    *   Execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to complete compromise of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `addCourseExe.php` page.
*   The attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to this page, with a malicious payload in the `course_name` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable page.
*   No specific user privileges on the application are stated as required to exploit the vulnerability, however access to the admin panel is required as the vulnerable page resides within it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Campcodes Online Examination System With Timer".
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `addCourseExe.php` file.
*   The code extracts POST data and directly uses the `course_name` variable in a SQL query for both checking and inserting new course.

**Example Attack:**
The provided example shows a Burp Request using the parameter `course_name=name` along with a command using `sqlmap` to test the injection, suggesting that the vulnerability is easily exploitable with standard tools.
