# End-of-life product list

When a product is end-of-life, it means:

* It is no longer manufactured
* Its certification will not be renewed
* Its firmware, utility, website, DM, QSG and manual will not be updated
* It may be replaced by a new product with updated hardware and similar functions

If the product/version1 you are looking for is end-of-life, it is recommended to purchase the
latest version or other similar models2. However, an EOL will not change the limited warranty
period for hardware.
