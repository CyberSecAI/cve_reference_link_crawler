```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to command execution due to insecure file upload handling at the **form/efms_exec_html/file_upload_parser.php** endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unrestricted file upload leading to remote code execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the server. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a POST request with a malicious PHP file to the vulnerable **file_upload_parser.php** endpoint. The file is saved in a temporary directory, and then the attacker sends a GET request to execute it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable endpoint and authentication token `se-authentication-token`, and `mode=deploy` which is present in the Cookie header."
