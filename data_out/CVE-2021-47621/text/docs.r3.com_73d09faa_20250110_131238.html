## [Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.12 release notes](#corda-enterprise-edition-4812-release-notes) [heading-link-icon](#corda-enterprise-edition-4812-release-notes)

Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.12 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise Edition focused on resolving issues.

### [Upgrade recommendation](#upgrade-recommendation) [heading-link-icon](#upgrade-recommendation)

As a developer or node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](/en/platform/corda/4.10/enterprise.html) as soon as possible. The latest Corda Enterprise release notes are on this page, and you can find the latest upgrade guide [here](/en/platform/corda/4.10/enterprise/upgrading-index.html).

### [Fixed issues](#fixed-issues) [heading-link-icon](#fixed-issues)

* `ReceiveTransactionFlow` was checking that the network parameters on the transaction existed before `ResolveTransactionFlow` was executed.
  This could cause a problem in certain scenarios; for example, when sending a top-level transaction to a new node in a migrated network, as the old network parameters would not exist on this new node. This has now been fixed.
* When resolving a party, in some code paths, `wellKnownPartyFromAnonymous` did not consider notaries from network parameters when trying to resolve an X.500 name. This scenario could occur when introducing a new node to a newly-migrated network as the new node would not have the old notary in its network map. This has now been fixed. Notaries from network parameters are now considered in the check.
* Delays when performing an SSL handshake with new nodes no longer impacts existing connections with other nodes.
* Previously, the order of the states in vault query results would sometimes be incorrect if they belonged to the same transaction. This issue has been resolved.
* Added improvements to node thread names to make logging and debugging clearer.
* Vault queries have been optimised to avoid the extra SQL query for the total state count where possible.
* Some log messages at warning level relating to failed SSL handshakes were accidentally introduced as part of improvements to SSL certificate handling in the previous patch release, and would appear frequently in the logs as part of connectivity tests of traffic load balancers and system monitoring. These log messages have been silenced to reduce “noise” in the logs.

## [Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.11 release notes](#corda-enterprise-edition-4811-release-notes) [heading-link-icon](#corda-enterprise-edition-4811-release-notes)

Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.11 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise focused on new functionality and resolving issues.

### [Upgrade recommendation](#upgrade-recommendation-1) [heading-link-icon](#upgrade-recommendation-1)

As a developer or node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](/en/platform/corda/4.10/enterprise.html) as soon as possible. The latest Corda Enterprise release notes are on this page, and you can find the latest upgrade guide [here](/en/platform/corda/4.10/enterprise/upgrading-index.html).

### [Fixed issues](#fixed-issues-1) [heading-link-icon](#fixed-issues-1)

* The certificate revocation checking has been improved with the introduction of a read timeout on the download of the certificate revocation lists (CRLs). The default CRL connect timeout has also been adjusted to better suit Corda nodes. The caching of CRLs has been increased from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
* When a notary worker is shut down, message ID cleanup is now performed as the last shutdown activity, rather than the first; this prevents a situation where the notary worker might still appear to be part of the notary cluster and receiving client traffic while shutting down.
* Flow checkpoint dumps now include a `status` field which shows the status of the flow; in particular, whether it is hospitalized or not.
* Debug logging of the Artemis server has been added.
* During recovery from a transport-layer connection break in peer-to-peer connectivity, a workaround to a bug in the Artemis message broker was only performed during the first break in connectivity. This led to a rare failure to re-establish connectivity between two peers until the node was restarted. The workaround is now performed on every loss of connectivity, and thus peer-to-peer connectivity should now always be re-established without operator intervention.
* The default value for the node configuration value `cryptoServiceTimeout` has been increased from 1 second to 10 seconds.
* A rare condition was fixed relating to rollback of database transactions under heavy load, which caused flow state machine threads to stop processing flows, leading to eventual node lock up in certain circumstances.
* Previously, a memory leak in the transaction cache occurred due to the weight of in-flight entries being undervalued. Improvements have been made to prevent in-flight entry weights from being undervalued and because they are now estimated more correctly, this results in a large decrease in the total size of cached entities.
* Flow draining mode no longer acknowledges P2P in-flight messages that have not yet been committed to the database. Previously, flow draining mode acknowledged all in-flight messages as duplicate.
* Previously, when loading checkpoints, the only log messages recorded were at the end of the process, recording the total number of checkpoints loaded.

  Now, the following additional logging has been added:

  + Checkpoints: Logging has been added for the two types of checkpoints - runnable and paused flows - being loaded; log messages show the number of checkpoints loaded every 30 seconds until all checkpoints have been loaded.
  + Finished flows: Log messages now show the number of finished flows.

  For example:

  ```
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:12,767Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Loading checkPoints flows {}
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:12,903Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Number of runnable flows: 0. Number of paused flows: 0 {}
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:12,911Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Started loading finished flows {}
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:28,437Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Loaded 9001 finished flows {}
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:43,606Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Loaded 24001 finished flows {}
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:46,650Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Number of finished flows : 27485 {}

  ```
* A fix for cache eviction has been applied where an issue resulted in an incorrect contract verification status while a database transaction was in progress during contract verification.
* The default SSL handshake timeout for inbound connections has been increased to 60 seconds. If during SSL handshake, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) take a long time to download, or are unreachable, then this 60 seconds gives the node enough time to establish the connection if `crlCheckSoftFail` is enabled.
* Compatibility when using the performance test suite from Apple silicon Macs has been improved.
* The default SSL handshake timeout for inbound connections has been increased to 60 seconds. If during SSL handshake, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) take a long time to download, or are unreachable, then this 60 seconds gives the node enough time to establish the connection if crlCheckSoftFail is enabled.
* Debug logging of the Artemis server has been added.

## [Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.10 release notes](#corda-enterprise-edition-4810-release-notes) [heading-link-icon](#corda-enterprise-edition-4810-release-notes)

Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.10 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise focused on resolving issues.

### [Upgrade recommendation](#upgrade-recommendation-2) [heading-link-icon](#upgrade-recommendation-2)

As a developer or node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](/en/platform/corda/4.8/enterprise.html) as soon as possible. The latest Corda Enterprise release notes are on this page, and you can find the latest upgrade guide [here](upgrading-index.md).

### [Fixed issues](#fixed-issues-2) [heading-link-icon](#fixed-issues-2)

* Previously, when configured to use confidential identities and the Securosys PrimusX HSM, it was possible for Corda to fail to generate a wrapped key-pair for a new confidential identity. This would cause a temporary key-pair to be leaked, consuming resources in the HSM. This issue occurred when:

  + The Securosys HSM was configured in a master-clone cluster.
  + The master HSM had failed and Corda had failed-over to use the clone HSM.
  + There was an attempt to create a transaction using confidential identities.

  The issue is now resolved. When generating a wrapped key-pair, the temporary key-pair is not persisted in the HSM and thus cannot be leaked.

  On applying this update, R3 recommends that the PrimusX JCE should be upgraded to version 2.3.4 or later for optimum performance of the HSM. If the JCE is not updated, then no keys are leaked but they are temporarily created in the HSM and are then garbage-collected within 24 hours.

  There is no need to upgrade the HSM firmware version for this update, but R3 recommends to keep the firmware up to date as a matter of course. Currently the latest firmware version is 2.8.50.

## [Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.9 release notes](#corda-enterprise-edition-489-release-notes) [heading-link-icon](#corda-enterprise-edition-489-release-notes)

### [Fixed issues](#fixed-issues-4) [heading-link-icon](#fixed-issues-4)

In this patch release:

* Java serialization has been disabled in the Corda firewall, closing a potential security vulnerability.
* The time it takes for first-time flows to be run in a signed CorDapp has been significantly reduced. This was achieved by fixing a regression introduced in Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8 involving the `ServiceLoader` used to load the `SerializationWhitelist`.

* `BatchSignLatency` represents the time elapsed during a batch signature, in milliseconds.

See [Monitoring Notary Latency](notary/faq/notary-latency-monitoring.md) for more information.

## [Fixed issues](#fixed-issues-11) [heading-link-icon](#fixed-issues-11)

Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8 fixes:

* A security issue that affects notary systems that use the JPA notary implementation in an HA configuration and when the notary backing database has been set up using the Corda database management tool. The new version of the Corda [database management tool](/en/platform/corda/4.8/enterprise/database-management-tool.html) must be re-run for the fix to take effect.
* Several issues that cause memory leaks. As a result, we have added a new node configuration field - `enableURLConnectionCache` - and we have modified the `attachmentClassLoaderCacheSize` node configuration field. See the [node configuration fields page](../../../../../en/platform/corda/4.8/enterprise/node/setup/corda-configuration-fields.html#enterpriseconfiguration) for details.
* An issue where the node is unable to resolve transaction chains that contain states or contracts that it did not relate to installed CorDapps.
* Flow state, invocation source, and suspension source filters breaking in the node GUI.
* Transaction verification being performed outside of the attachments class loader.
* HA utilities not logging messages that state that the master key is not needed when using a native mode HSM.
* HA utilities not logging information about the `freshIdentitiesConfiguration`.
* Log messages incorrectly stating that a confidential identity key has been created.
* An issue that causes the node to hang if shut down using `SIGTERM`.
* Attachment presence cache containing the attachment contents.
* The Corda Firewall throwing an error when retrieving version information.
* HA utilities creating erroneous logs when using confidential identities.

## [Known issues](#known-issues) [heading-link-icon](#known-issues)

* An issue with the Oracle 12c database that causes the JDBC driver to hang if blocked by an empty entropy pool.

This issue is specific to Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8. Known issues relating to other versions of Corda Enterprise are listed in the release notes for each version.
