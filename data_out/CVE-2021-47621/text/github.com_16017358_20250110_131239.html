| Great contribution, thanks! I wasn't even aware of this vulnerability, even though I'm very familiar with the OWASP guidelines for the Web. It seems like the JDK team should make this the default! |

| You're welcome... I'm curious how you even spotted this vulnerability. It's in an obscure piece of code that tries to determine the ClassGraph version by reading `pom.xml`. |

| Just a heads up this has been assigned CVE-2021-47621.  Are you sure you have that right? That CVE is for the Guest Entries PHP library -- it doesn't even apply to the Java ecosystem.  FYI the vulnerability in the original bug report had a very low likelihood of causing a problem (you'd have to have access to the build system to execute this vulnerability, and if you had that access, you could do a lot more malicious stuff than this. |

| [@thc202](https://github.com/thc202) Oh, Google Search's top result when searching for that number was the wrong result, it was 2023-47621.  So let's consider the impact of this vulnerability in some detail, since it is still coming up 3 years later:   1. You'd have to be running a version of ClassGraph from 3+ years ago (and if you are updating your deps that infrequently, you should expect to be hit by security vulnerabilities and bugs!). 2. You would have to be running in a source tree or jar in which both the `ClassGraph.class` binary file and the `pom.xml` Maven config file are both present (i.e. this would not apply to production builds, shaded jars, etc.). 3. A hacker would have to have write access to the `pom.xml` file (which if they did, they could use this access to do much more nefarious things with a lot less effort).   Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I see this as a non-issue. |
