  "CVE-2021-47621": {
    "Description": "The classgraph library, as used in Corda, is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. The vulnerability exists in the VersionFinder.java file. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server, leading to information disclosure, or possibly cause a denial of service attack by including a large XML file. The vulnerability is caused by using insecure defaults in DocumentBuilderFactory and XPathFactory.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of insecure default settings when creating XML parsers (DocumentBuilderFactory and XPathFactory) in `VersionFinder.java`. These defaults allowed external entities to be resolved during XML processing, leading to the XXE vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could read arbitrary files on the server, resulting in information disclosure, or trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by including a large XML file.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating or crafting a malicious `pom.xml` file, which is parsed by the vulnerable code when trying to determine the version of Classgraph.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to have write access to the `pom.xml` file on the server where Classgraph is running. They would also need to be able to trigger the code that parses the `pom.xml` file. This access is typically only possible on development or build systems, not production systems."
