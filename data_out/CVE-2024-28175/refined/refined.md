The provided content is related to CVE-2024-28175.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper filtering of URL protocols within the `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotations in the Argo CD application summary component. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or validate external URLs, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious `javascript:` links.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS due to lack of input sanitization and validation of URLs.
- Improper URL filtering: The application doesn't properly filter out malicious URL protocols such as `javascript:`.
- Injection of malicious links: Attackers can inject malicious `javascript:` links using the `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotation on Kubernetes resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: A malicious user can inject JavaScript code that will execute within the context of another user's browser session when the victim clicks on the crafted link.
- Privilege escalation: The injected JavaScript runs with the victim’s permissions, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on the victim’s behalf. This can include actions like creating, modifying, or deleting Kubernetes resources through the API.
- Data theft or manipulation: Due to the execution in the victim's browser, the attacker might also be able to steal cookies, access sensitive information, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotations: The attacker injects malicious `javascript:` links into Kubernetes resources via the `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotation.
- User interaction: The victim must click on the malicious external link displayed in the Argo CD UI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to modify Kubernetes resources that are managed by Argo CD.
- This typically means they need to have write access to the Kubernetes resources used by Argo CD.
- No special position or advanced skills are needed, the attacker only needs to craft a malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Argo CD starting from v1.0.0 up to and including v2.10.2, 2.9.7, and 2.8.11.
- Patches are available in versions 2.10.3, 2.9.8, and 2.8.12.
- The vulnerability is rated as critical, with a CVSS score of 9.1.
- The attack vector is network-based.
- User interaction is required, as the victim needs to click on the injected link.
- The scope of impact is changed. The vulnerability in the application summary component can impact resources beyond it's own security scope.
- The vulnerability allows for high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-80.
