Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `/adminpanel/admin/facebox_modal/updateCourse.php` file. This means that an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** Exploitation could lead to the leakage of sensitive user data or system data.
*   **Compromised System Security:** The overall security of the system may be compromised, likely through unauthorized access and potential modifications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to `/adminpanel/admin/facebox_modal/updateCourse.php` with a malicious SQL payload injected into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must know the `id` parameter in the `updateCourse.php` file is vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided payload in the description `id=1'+AND+(SELECT+1234+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))updateCourse)+AND+'x'='x` confirms that it is a time-based SQL injection vulnerability. The `SLEEP(2)` function will cause the database to delay execution by two seconds, indicating a successful injection.
* The vulnerable software is identified as "campcodes Online Examination System â‰¤1.0"
