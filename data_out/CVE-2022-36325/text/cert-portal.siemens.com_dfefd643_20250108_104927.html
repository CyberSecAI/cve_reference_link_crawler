SUMMARY

SCALANCE devices contain multiple vulnerabilities in MSPS based product lines that could allow authen-
ticated remote attackers to execute custom code or create a XSS situation, as well as unauthenticated
remote attackers to create a denial of service condition.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply the principle of least privileges for accounts conﬁgured on the affected devices
• Restrict network access in affected system(s) to ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP to trusted IP addresses

and personal only

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE M-800, MUM-800 and S615 as well as the RUGGEDCOM RM1224 are industrial routers.

SCALANCE SC-600 devices are used to protect trusted industrial networks from untrusted networks.
They allow ﬁltering incoming and outgoing network connections in different ways.

SCALANCE W-1700 products are wireless communication devices based on IEEE 802.11ac standard.
They are used to connect all to sorts of WLAN devices (Access Points or Clients, depending on the
operating mode) with a strong focus on industrial components, like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and others.

SCALANCE W-700 products are wireless communication devices based on IEEE 802.11ax or 802.11n
standard. They are used to connect all to sorts of WLAN devices (Access Points or Clients, depending on
the operating mode) with a strong focus on industrial components, like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and others.

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-36323

Affected devices do not properly sanitize an input ﬁeld. This could allow an authenticated remote
attacker with administrative privileges to inject code or spawn a system root shell.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

9.1
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used
by a Downstream Component (’Injection’)

Vulnerability CVE-2022-36324

Affected devices do not properly handle the renegotiation of SSL/TLS parameters. This could allow
an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass the TCP brute force prevention and lead to a denial of
service condition for the duration of the attack.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

7.5
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

Vulnerability CVE-2022-36325

Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface.
This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and
lead to a DOM-based XSS.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

6.8
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a
Web Page (Basic XSS)
