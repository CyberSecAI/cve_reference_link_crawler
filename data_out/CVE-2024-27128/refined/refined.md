- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Buffer copy without checking size of input
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a buffer copy without proper size checks of the input data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker who has gained user access
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have gained user access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
