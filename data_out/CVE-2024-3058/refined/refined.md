- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "ENL Newsletter" lacks CSRF protection and proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input when creating newsletters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Stored XSS vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input.
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The plugin lacks CSRF checks, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the newsletter which will be executed when a user views the newsletter, leading to potential actions like session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can create a malicious HTML file containing a crafted form that, when opened by a logged-in administrator, will submit the malicious data to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a specially crafted HTML file.
