# Advisory Details

October 15th, 2024
## QEMU SCSI Use-After-Free Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-24-1382ZDI-CAN-23962

| CVE ID | [CVE-2024-6519](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6519) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.2, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | QEMU |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | QEMU |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of QEMU. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the virtual LSI53C895A SCSI Host Bus Adapter. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | QEMU has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2292089#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-06-12 23:03:51 UTC  ``` There is an use-after-free vulnerability in QEMU LSI53C895A SCSI Host Bus Adapter emulation, which can lead to VM escape. The crash noticed in this case is an write to freed memory. But given the complexity of the freed structure, multiple primitives like dereferencing function pointers, etc., should be possible.   ``` |  |
