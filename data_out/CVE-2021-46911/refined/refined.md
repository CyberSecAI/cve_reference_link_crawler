Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2021-46911.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in the `chcr_ktls_xmit` function within the `ch_ktls` driver, related to handling of TLS records. Specifically, the code was taking a page reference count which was not ideal, as it could lead to a kernel panic if an ACK was received during the transmission process and the page cleanup occurred prematurely.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition when taking page reference counts
- Potential for premature page cleanup due to ACK reception

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering TLS record transmission via the `chcr_ktls_xmit` function in a way that an ACK is received in the middle of the transmission.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to send network traffic that would trigger the vulnerable code path in the `ch_ktls` driver. This implies having control of a network connection using the driver.
