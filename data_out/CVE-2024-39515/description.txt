An Improper Validation of Consistency within Input vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker sending a specifically malformed BGP packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

In some cases, rpd fails to restart requiring a manual restart via the 'restart routing' CLI command.

This issue only affects systems with BGP traceoptions enabled and 

requires a BGP session to be already established.  Systems without BGP traceoptions enabled are not affected by this issue.

This issue affects iBGP and eBGP, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.

This issue affects:
