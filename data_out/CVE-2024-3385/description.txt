A packet processing mechanism in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables a remote attacker to reboot hardware-based firewalls. Repeated attacks eventually cause the firewall to enter maintenance mode, which requires manual intervention to bring the firewall back online.

This affects the following hardware firewall models:
- PA-5400 Series firewalls
- PA-7000 Series firewalls
