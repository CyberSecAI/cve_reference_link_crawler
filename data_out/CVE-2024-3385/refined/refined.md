- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A packet processing mechanism in PAN-OS software allows a remote attacker to reboot hardware-based firewalls when GTP Security is disabled. Repeated attacks cause the firewall to enter maintenance mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
    - NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote reboot of hardware-based firewalls
    - Firewall entering maintenance mode, requiring manual intervention to restore operation.
    - High Availability impact
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker is required. The attacker must be able to send crafted packets to the affected firewall.
- **Additional details**:
    - The vulnerability affects only hardware-based firewalls (PA-5400 and PA-7000 series) with GTP Security disabled.
    - VM-Series firewalls, CN-Series firewalls, Cloud NGFWs, and Prisma Access are not affected.
    - The vulnerability was discovered externally and encountered by two customers in normal production usage.
    - Threat ID 94993 can be used for mitigation with a Threat Prevention subscription.
