The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access, modification, and loss of data due to a missing capability check on multiple functions in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.14. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add, modify, or delete post meta and plugin options.
