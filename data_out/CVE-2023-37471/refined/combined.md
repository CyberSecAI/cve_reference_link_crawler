# User impersonation using SAMLv1.x SSO process.

Critical

[maximthomas](/maximthomas)
published
GHSA-4mh8-9wq6-rjxg
Jul 20, 2023

## Package

maven

org.openidentityplatform.openam:openam-federation-library
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

14.7.2

## Patched versions

14.7.3

## Description

### Impact

OpenAM up to version 14.7.2 does not properly validate the signature of

SAML responses received as part of the SAMLv1.x Single Sign-On process.

Attackers can use this fact to impersonate any OpenAM user, including the

administrator, by sending a specially crafted SAML response to the

SAMLPOSTProfileServlet servlet.

### Patches

This problem has been patched in OpenAM 14.7.3-SNAPSHOT and later

### Workarounds

One should comment servlet `SAMLPOSTProfileServlet` in web.xml or disable SAML in OpenAM

```
<servlet>
    <description>SAMLPOSTProfileServlet</description>
    <servlet-name>SAMLPOSTProfileServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.sun.identity.saml.servlet.SAMLPOSTProfileServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
...
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>SAMLSOAPReceiver</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/SAMLSOAPReceiver</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```
### References

| Have you considered removing the `if (samlResponse.isSigned())` check in [`SAMLUtils.processResponse`](https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/blob/3974a1aa0d413192a168aadb1ad49776efef3c02/openam-federation/openam-federation-library/src/main/java/com/sun/identity/saml/common/SAMLUtils.java#L1583) as well? As it is now it looks a bit like a footgun to me: if someone uses the method somewhere else where validating the signature is a requirement, the same issue that is being fixed here could reproduce. |
