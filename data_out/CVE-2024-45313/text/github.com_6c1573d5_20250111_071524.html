## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

When installing [Server Pro](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises) using the [Overleaf Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit) from before 2024-07-17 or [legacy docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) from before 2024-08-28, the configuration for LaTeX compiles was insecure by default, requiring the administrator to enable the security features via a configuration setting (`SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED` in Toolkit, `SANDBOXED_COMPILES` in legacy docker-compose/custom deployments).

If these security features are not enabled then users have access to the `sharelatex` container resources (filesystem, network, environment variables) when running compiles, leading to multiple file access vulnerabilities, either directly or via symlinks created during compiles.

The setting has now been changed to be secure by default for new installs in the Toolkit and legacy docker-compose deployment.

This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Stefan Schiller ([@stefan-schiller-sonarsource](https://github.com/stefan-schiller-sonarsource)), vulnerability researcher at [SonarSource](https://www.sonarsource.com/). We thank Stefan and Sonar for their responsible disclosure and collaboration in addressing this issue.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The Overleaf Toolkit has been updated to set `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true` by default for new installs

([overleaf/toolkit@7a84018](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/commit/7a8401897b24777b47338452ff8d12e2fb6dd5ff)).

We recommend that any existing installations using the previous default setting migrate to using sibling containers.

To check the configuration, look for the current setting of `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED` in the Server Pro configuration

```
$ grep SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED config/overleaf.rc

```

Summary:

* `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=false` allows users to access all container resources during compiles.
* `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true` runs compile processes in separate docker containers with restrictive `seccomp` profiles.

Legacy docker-compose/custom deployments:

The docker-compose.yml file has been updated to set `SANDBOXED_COMPILES` by default for new installs ([169723f](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/commit/169723f492eb083ae3ebd5c6038b04a7a0bdf4a7)).

```
$ grep SANDBOXED_COMPILES docker-compose.yml

```

`SANDBOXED_COMPILES=true` is equivalent to `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true`; Other values or no value set for `SANDBOXED_COMPILES` is equivalent to `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=false` as detailed above for the Overleaf Toolkit.

Note: Sibling containers are not available in Community Edition, which is intended for use in environments where all users are trusted. Community Edition is not appropriate for scenarios where isolation of users is required.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Existing installations can set `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true` in `config/overleaf.rc` and follow the instructions below.

In legacy docker-compose/custom deployments `SANDBOXED_COMPILES=true` should be used.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

See the instructions [Enabling sibling containers](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/blob/master/doc/sandboxed-compiles.md#enabling-sibling-containers) in the Overleaf Toolkit documentation and wiki for [legacy docker-compose/custom deployments](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki/Server-Pro%3A-Sandboxed-Compiles).
