  "CVE-2024-45313": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Insecure default setting for Server Pro installed via Overleaf toolkit before 2024-07-17 and docker-compose before 2024-08-28",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The default configuration for LaTeX compiles in Overleaf Server Pro installations prior to the specified dates was insecure. Specifically, the `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED` setting in the Overleaf Toolkit and the `SANDBOXED_COMPILES` setting in legacy docker-compose deployments were not enabled by default.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "When these settings are not enabled, users have access to the `sharelatex` container resources (filesystem, network, environment variables) during compiles.",
        "This allows for multiple file access vulnerabilities either directly or via symlinks created during compiles.",
         "CWE-284: Improper Access Control",
         "CWE-1188: Insecure Default Configuration"
      ],
      "impact": "Users can access the `sharelatex` container resources (filesystem, network, environment variables) when running compiles leading to file access vulnerabilities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Direct file access",
        "File access via symlinks created during compiles"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a user with the ability to run LaTeX compiles on an affected Overleaf instance with the insecure settings."
