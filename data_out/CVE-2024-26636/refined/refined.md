{
  "CVE-2024-26636": {
    "status": "relevant",
    "details": {
      "Root cause": "The `llc_ui_sendmsg()` function in the Linux kernel's LLC (Logical Link Control) implementation releases the socket lock before calling `sock_alloc_send_skb()`, and then reacquires it without redoing all necessary sanity checks. This could lead to a race condition.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Race condition due to releasing and reacquiring socket lock without proper re-validation.",
        "Lack of sufficient headroom in allocated skb due to missing accounting for the Ethernet header and device's reserved space.",
         "Incorrect mtu calculation not considering reserved space"
      ],
      "Impact": "A crafted network message can lead to a kernel panic due to `skb_under_panic`. This could result in a denial-of-service.",
      "Attack vectors": "A local or remote attacker who can send messages via an LLC socket.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted message via an LLC socket, possibly through network interface manipulation or by exploiting another vulnerability leading to such access."

        "net/llc/af_llc.c"
