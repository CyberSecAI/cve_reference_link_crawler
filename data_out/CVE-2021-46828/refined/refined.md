Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper error handling in the `svc_run` function of the `libtirpc` library. Specifically, two issues were introduced by commit b2c9430f46c4:
    - The `svc_run` function no longer handles poll timeouts.
    - The `rendezvous_request` function no longer handles `EMFILE` errors returned by `accept(2)`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Poll Timeout Handling:** The lack of poll timeout handling allows idle TCP connections to remain in the `ESTABLISHED` state indefinitely.
- **Missing EMFILE Error Handling:** When the number of connections reaches the system's open file descriptor limit (`ulimit -n`), the `accept(2)` system call fails with an `EMFILE` error.  The absence of `EMFILE` error handling causes the `svc_run()` function to get stuck in a tight loop, repeatedly calling `accept(2)` without any mechanism to recover.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By establishing a sufficient number of connections to the vulnerable `libtirpc` service, an attacker can exhaust the process's open file descriptor limit.  This will lead to the service becoming unresponsive and unable to accept any new requests. The RPC service becomes unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by establishing TCP connections to the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish TCP connections to the server running the vulnerable `libtirpc` service.
- **Multiple Connection Establishment:** The attacker needs to be able to open enough connections to exhaust the server's file descriptor limits.

**Summary of Findings:**

The vulnerability is caused by the removal of timeout and error handling which can be triggered remotely, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service.  The content from Gentoo, Debian, and NetApp all refer to the same underlying issue in libtirpc. Specifically, they identify the missing handling of poll timeout and EMFILE errors as the root cause which are exploited by creating multiple connections. The impact is consistently reported as a denial of service.
