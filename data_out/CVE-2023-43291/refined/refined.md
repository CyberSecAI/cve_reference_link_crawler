{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in emlog's caching mechanism, specifically in how it handles serialized data. The application stores serialized data in cache files prefixed with `<?php exit;//` to prevent direct access. However, when reading the cache, it simply removes this prefix and unserializes the rest of the content. This process allows an attacker to inject `<?php exit;//` into the serialized data, leading to string escape during unserialization. By manipulating the cache data, attackers can inject arbitrary data which could lead to SQL injection vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unserialize string escape",
    "SQL injection",
    "Remote code execution (RCE)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to SQL injection, which can be further exploited for privilege escalation and remote code execution by modifying the database content.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Manipulating the alias field during blog creation or update to inject malicious serialized data into the cache.",
    "Sending crafted HTTP requests with the `X-Rewrite-Url` header to trigger the vulnerable code path."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create or edit blog posts in the application, and the ability to send HTTP requests. The attacker also needs to know the way the application handles routing and caching"
