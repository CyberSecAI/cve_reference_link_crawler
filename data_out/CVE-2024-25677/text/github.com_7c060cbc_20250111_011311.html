# Incorrect local file restrictions in Min

High

[PalmerAL](/PalmerAL)
published
GHSA-4w9v-7h8h-rv8x
Feb 1, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

Version 1.29.0 (1.29.0)

## Patched versions

1.31.0

## Description

Local files in Min are not correctly treated as unique security origins, which allows them to improperly request cross-origin resources. The original report demonstrates a scenario in which a local file requests other local files through an XML document.

Note that the original issue summary is not entirely correct, as the issue in fact only occurs when a local file is opened inside Min, and does not occur on http(s) URLs.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
