A full list of changes in this build is available in the Log.Security Fixes and RewardsNote: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.This update includes 6 security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the Chrome Security Page for more information.[$11000][336012573] High CVE-2024-5157: Use after free in Scheduling.
